## Career Overview
- **Total Careers**: 2
- **Total Terms**: 5
- **Career Sequence**: Mercantile (2 terms) → Mercantile/Drafted (3 terms)

---

## Career 1: Mercantile (2 terms)

### Qualification
- **Target**: INT 7+
- **Modifier**: +1 (INT 10)
- **Roll**: 6
- **Total**: 7
- **Result**: Pass (exactly)
- **P(Success)**: 72.22% (with +1 modifier)
- **Assessment**: Made it by the skin of his teeth. Needed 6+ and rolled exactly 6. A roll of 5 would have meant draft or Drifter — his entire career trajectory hung on this single point.

### Basic Training
- **Table**: Service
- **Rolls**: [6, 1]
- **Skills Gained**: Steward-1, Broker-1
- **Assessment**: Excellent draw. Both skills are core Mercantile competencies that would stack repeatedly with later training, setting up his eventual mastery.

### Training (2 terms)

| Term | Table   | Roll | Result       | Notes |
|------|---------|------|--------------|-------|
| 1    | Service | 5    | Streetwise-1 | Fits "Streets" background perfectly |
| 2    | Service | 6    | Steward-2    | Stacks with basic training |

- **Skill Summary**: Broker-1, Steward-2, Streetwise-1
- **Assessment**: Good synergy. Rolling Steward on term 2 built on basic training, beginning the pattern of skill stacking that would define his career.

### Special Assignments

| Term | Roll | Result |
|------|------|--------|
| 1    | 12   | Bonus (natural 12!) |
| 2    | 4    | None |

- **Expected Successes**: 1.17
- **Actual Successes**: 1
- **Assessment**: Average quantity, but that natural 12 on term 1 was a memorable moment — the best possible roll.

### Bonus Training

| # | Table   | Roll | Result      |
|---|---------|------|-------------|
| 1 | Service | 2    | Carousing-1 |

- **Assessment**: Carousing fits the character perfectly — the charming purser who throws the best crew parties.

### Leadership

- **Target**: EDU 7+
- **Modifier**: -1 (EDU 5)
- **P(Success per term)**: 41.67%
- **Expected Promotions**: 0.83

| Term | Roll | Total | Result  |
|------|------|-------|---------|
| 1    | 4    | 3     | None    |
| 2    | 8    | 7     | Promoted (Rank 1) |

- **Final Rank**: 1
- **Rank Benefits**: Broker-2
- **Assessment**: Matched expectation. The -1 modifier from low EDU made promotion difficult (only 42% per term), but he squeaked through on term 2.

### Retirement

**Cash:**
- **Roll**: 9
- **Rank Modifier**: +1
- **Total**: 10
- **Result**: 30,000 Cr
- **Assessment**: Solid roll, one bracket below maximum.

**Material Benefits (3 rolls = 2 terms + 1 rank):**

| Roll | Result |
|------|--------|
| 5    | Personal Vehicle |
| 3    | +1 EDU (5→6) |
| 4    | +1 SOC (3→4) |

- **Summary**: 1 vehicle, +1 EDU, +1 SOC
- **Assessment**: Excellent spread. The attribute bumps helped offset his weak starting stats — EDU improvement would make career 2 leadership easier (modifier goes from -1 to 0).

### Career 1 Summary
William's first Mercantile career was a foundation-building phase. He barely qualified, advanced slowly due to poor education, but made the most of his opportunities. The natural 12 on his first special assignment showed flashes of the luck that would define his second career. He left at 26 with core Mercantile skills, improved attributes, and a ground car — ready for whatever came next.

## Career 2: Mercantile/Drafted (3 terms)

### Qualification
- **Attempted**: Military
- **Target**: STR 5+
- **Modifier**: 0 (STR 8)
- **Roll**: 4
- **Total**: 4
- **Result**: Fail
- **P(Success)**: 83.33%
- **Assessment**: Very unlucky. Military has an 83% base success rate, and he rolled below the threshold. This failure forced him back into Mercantile via draft — but narratively, this "failure" led to his greatest success under Vasquez's mentorship.

### Training (3 terms)

| Term | Table   | Roll | Result      | Notes |
|------|---------|------|-------------|-------|
| 1    | Service | 1    | Broker-3    | Stacks to rank 3 |
| 2    | Service | 2    | Carousing-2 | Stacks to rank 2 |
| 3    | Service | 6    | Steward-3   | Stacks to rank 3 |

- **Skill Summary**: Broker-3, Carousing-2, Steward-3
- **Assessment**: Remarkable skill stacking. Every single roll advanced an existing skill rather than gaining something new. The dice were building a master merchant.

### Special Assignments

| Term | Roll | Result |
|------|------|--------|
| 1    | 8    | Bonus  |
| 2    | 9    | Bonus  |
| 3    | 9    | Bonus  |

- **Expected Successes**: 1.75
- **Actual Successes**: 3 (perfect!)
- **P(3/3 successes)**: 19.85%
- **Assessment**: Very lucky. Three for three on special assignments happens less than 20% of the time. Narratively: Vasquez gave him prime assignments where he could shine.

### Bonus Training

| # | Table   | Roll | Result      |
|---|---------|------|-------------|
| 1 | Service | 3    | Diplomacy-1 |
| 2 | Service | 2    | Carousing-3 |
| 3 | Service | 2    | Carousing-4 |

- **Assessment**: Two consecutive Carousing rolls (both 2s) pushed this skill to rank 4. Combined with the sabbatical, this would become his signature ability at rank 5.

### Leadership

- **Target**: EDU 7+
- **Modifier**: 0 (EDU 6 after career 1 retirement)
- **P(Success per term)**: 58.33%
- **Expected Promotions**: 1.75

| Term | Roll | Total | Result  |
|------|------|-------|---------|
| 1    | 10   | 10    | Promoted (Rank 1) |
| 2    | 8    | 8     | Promoted (Rank 2) |
| 3    | 8    | 8     | Promoted (Rank 3) |

- **Final Rank**: 3
- **Rank Benefits**: Broker-4, Steward-4, +1 EDU (6→7)
- **Assessment**: Very lucky. Three for three promotions with 58% odds each time. P(3/3) = 19.85%. Combined with perfect special assignments, William hit ~4% odds of both occurring.

### Retirement

**Cash:**
- **Roll**: 10
- **Rank Modifier**: +3
- **Total**: 13
- **Result**: 45,000 Cr
- **Assessment**: Excellent. High roll plus rank bonus reached second-highest bracket.

**Material Benefits (6 rolls = 3 terms + 3 rank):**

| Roll | Result |
|------|--------|
| 6    | Personal Vehicle |
| 6    | Personal Vehicle |
| 1    | High Passage |
| 6    | Personal Vehicle |
| 1    | High Passage |
| 5    | Personal Vehicle |

- **Summary**: 4 Personal Vehicles, 2 High Passages
- **Assessment**: Extremely lucky on vehicles — four results of 5-6 out of six rolls. The vehicle haul enabled the shuttlecraft. No attribute bumps, but the rank benefits already provided +1 EDU.

### Career 2 Summary
William's second career was blessed by the dice. After unluckily failing Military qualification (17% failure rate), everything went his way: perfect 3/3 on special assignments, perfect 3/3 on promotions, strong retirement rolls. The combined probability of his special assignment and leadership success was roughly 4% — this was genuinely exceptional luck. The narrative of Vasquez's mentorship perfectly explains these mechanics: she put him in positions to succeed, advocated for his promotions, and he delivered every time.

## Careers Overall Assessment

William Hung's career phase tells a story of redemption through patronage. His first career was modest — barely qualified, slow advancement, average results. His failed attempt at Military (rolling 4 when he needed 5 on an 83% check) could have derailed everything. Instead, being drafted back into Mercantile under Captain Vasquez's wing transformed his trajectory.

The second career saw exceptional luck:
- **Special Assignments**: 3/3 (19.85% odds)
- **Leadership**: 3/3 promotions (19.85% odds)
- **Combined**: ~4% probability

**Final Career Statistics:**
- **Total Cash**: 75,000 Cr (25,000 after sabbatical)
- **Total Skill Ranks**: 14 (Broker-4, Carousing-4→5, Diplomacy-1, Steward-4, Streetwise-1)
- **Attribute Improvements**: +2 EDU (5→7), +1 SOC (3→4)
- **Equipment**: 5 Personal Vehicles → Shuttlecraft + Ground Car + Grav Bike, 2 High Passages

The dice created a character who started rough, failed at branching out, but found his calling when a mentor gave him a second chance. His astronomical Carousing (eventually rank 5) and maxed-out Broker/Steward skills make him one of the most capable social operators in the sector — a reputation built on luck, skill, and the woman who believed in him when no one else did.
