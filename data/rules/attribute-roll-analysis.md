# Attribute Roll Analysis Methodology

This document provides a standardized methodology for analyzing whether a character's starting attribute rolls (2d6 x 6) were lucky, unlucky, or average.

## Overview

In Traveller Stephanus, starting attributes are generated by rolling 2d6 six times, assigned in order to STR, DEX, END, INT, EDU, and SOC. This methodology analyzes those rolls across multiple dimensions to provide a comprehensive "luck assessment."

### 2d6 Probability Distribution

| Roll | Combinations | Probability | Cumulative |
|------|--------------|-------------|------------|
| 2    | 1            | 2.78%       | 2.78%      |
| 3    | 2            | 5.56%       | 8.33%      |
| 4    | 3            | 8.33%       | 16.67%     |
| 5    | 4            | 11.11%      | 27.78%     |
| 6    | 5            | 13.89%      | 41.67%     |
| 7    | 6            | 16.67%      | 58.33%     |
| 8    | 5            | 13.89%      | 72.22%     |
| 9    | 4            | 11.11%      | 83.33%     |
| 10   | 3            | 8.33%       | 91.67%     |
| 11   | 2            | 5.56%       | 97.22%     |
| 12   | 1            | 2.78%       | 100.00%    |

**Key Statistics:**
- Expected value (mean): **7**
- Variance: **5.833**
- Standard deviation: **2.415**

### Attribute Modifier Table

| Score | Modifier |
|-------|----------|
| 2     | -2       |
| 3-5   | -1       |
| 6-8   | 0        |
| 9-11  | +1       |
| 12    | +2       |

### Six-Roll Sum Distribution

When summing six independent 2d6 rolls:
- Expected total: **42**
- Variance: 6 × 5.833 = **35**
- Standard deviation: **5.92**

Approximate percentiles for sum of six 2d6:

| Sum Range | Percentile | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|------------|
| ≤30       | ~2%        | Extremely unlucky |
| 31-35     | ~10%       | Very unlucky |
| 36-39     | ~25%       | Unlucky |
| 40-44     | ~50%       | Average |
| 45-48     | ~75%       | Lucky |
| 49-53     | ~90%       | Very lucky |
| ≥54       | ~98%       | Extremely lucky |

## Analysis Methodology

Perform the following four analyses for any character's starting attributes:

### 1. Sum Comparison

Calculate the total of all six rolls and compare to expected value.

```
Total = STR + DEX + END + INT + EDU + SOC
Expected = 42
Difference = Total - 42
```

**Interpretation:**
- Difference of 0: Exactly average
- Difference of ±1-3: Within normal variance
- Difference of ±4-6: Notably lucky/unlucky
- Difference of ±7+: Significantly lucky/unlucky

### 2. Net Modifier Analysis

Calculate the sum of all attribute modifiers.

```
For each attribute:
  2 → -2
  3-5 → -1
  6-8 → 0
  9-11 → +1
  12 → +2

Net Modifier = sum of all six modifiers
```

**Interpretation:**
- Net of 0: Average mechanical impact
- Net of +1 to +3: Lucky (advantaged in play)
- Net of -1 to -3: Unlucky (disadvantaged in play)
- Net of ±4+: Significantly lucky/unlucky

### 3. Percentile Analysis

For each individual roll, determine its percentile using the cumulative distribution table.

**Percentile Assessment Scale:**
- ≤8%: Very unlucky
- 9-28%: Unlucky
- 29-72%: Average
- 73-92%: Lucky
- ≥93%: Very lucky

Count how many rolls fall into each category.

### 4. Variance/Spread Analysis

Assess how "swingy" the rolls were.

```
Range = highest roll - lowest roll
```

**Interpretation:**
- Range ≤4: Low variance (consistent but unremarkable)
- Range 5-6: Normal variance
- Range 7-8: High variance (character of extremes)
- Range ≥9: Very high variance (dramatic peaks and valleys)

High variance often creates more interesting characters narratively, even if the sum is average.

### 4. Variance Analysis
- **Range**: 10 - 3 = 7
- **Assessment**: High variance

### Overall Assessment

William Hung's rolls were statistically average in aggregate (sum of 42, net modifier of 0) but exhibited high variance with a 7-point spread between his best and worst attributes. He was lucky in the attributes that matter for a Mercantile career (INT 10 for qualification, DEX 10 for versatility) but very unlucky in SOC (bottom 8%), which mechanically forced him into "The Streets" background and narratively shaped his entire arc as a low-born stowaway who had to earn everything through wit and skill rather than birthright. The dice gave him average raw material distributed in a way that created a compelling underdog story.
