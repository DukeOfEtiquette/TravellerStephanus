    Prior Careers and Faction Selection

    Players considered the faction alignment options and chose to work with the Jade Front.

    Players made at least two characters each, then chose one to play.

    Players selected their three ship NPC options (based on faction allegiance): Marine, Marine, and Deckhand.

    The Jade Front provided 150k in cash support, and 60k in material support. At the next session, we will finish shopping.

    Players were also presented with their faction-based starting ship upgrades. Determinations about this will be made at the start of the next session.

    Ship upgrade options (pick three):

    COMBAT UPGRADES
    - Beam Lasers (2d6)
    - [4] Missiles (4d6 each, 5g)
    - Shields-1
    - Armor-1

    ASSET UPGRADES
    - Armory-1
    - Staterooms-1
    - Staterooms-1
    - Barracks-1 (5 marines)
