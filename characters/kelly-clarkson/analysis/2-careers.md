### Special Assignments

| Term | Roll | Result |
|------|------|--------|
| 1    | 5    | None   |
| 2    | 8    | Bonus  |

### Bonus Training (from Special Assignments)

| # | Table    | Roll | Result        |
|---|----------|------|---------------|
| 1 | Advanced | 3    | Electronics-3 |
| 2 | Service  | 4    | Bushcraft-2   |
| 3 | Service  | 2    | Firearms-1    |

- **Assessment**: Rolling 3 on Advanced Education AGAIN pushed Electronics to rank 3. Remarkable consistency in dice results created a genuine specialist.

### Leadership

- **Target**: DEX 7+
- **Modifier**: 0 (DEX 8)
- **P(Success per term)**: 58.33%
- **Expected Promotions**: 2.33

| Term | Roll | Total | Result  |
|------|------|-------|---------|
| 1    | 8    | 8     | Promoted (Rank 1) |
| 2    | 6    | 6     | None    |
| 3    | 8    | 8     | Promoted (Rank 2) |
| 4    | 5    | 5     | None    |

- **Final Rank**: 2
- **Rank Benefits**: Athletics-2, +1 SOC (5→6)
- **Assessment**: Exactly average — 2 promotions in 4 terms matches expectation of 2.33

### Retirement

**Cash:**
- **Roll**: 11
- **Rank Modifier**: +2
- **Total**: 13
- **Result**: 24,000 Cr
- **Assessment**: Good roll (11 is 92nd percentile on 2d6), rank bonus helped reach higher bracket

**Material Benefits (6 rolls = 4 terms + 2 rank):**

| Roll | Result |
|------|--------|
| 3    | +1 INT (7→8) |
| 6    | Personal Vehicle |
| 2    | Weapon |
| 2    | Weapon |
| 2    | Weapon |
| 2    | Weapon |

- **Summary**: 1 attribute bump, 1 vehicle, 4 weapons
- **Assessment**: Mixed luck. The INT bump was valuable, and the vehicle useful, but rolling 2 four times in a row (weapons) when there were potentially better outcomes (attribute bumps on 3-5, vehicle on 6) was statistically unusual (1/1296 chance). She's well-armed but missed opportunities for more attribute improvements.

### Career 1 Summary
Kelly's Frontier career was successful overall. She qualified easily, gained excellent Electronics expertise through consistently rolling 3s on the Advanced Education table, and advanced to Rank 2 on schedule. The standout feature was her special assignment luck (3/4 successes) which provided bonus training that cemented her technical specialty. Retirement brought an unusual streak of weapon rolls — four 2s in a row — leaving her heavily armed for her next adventure.

| 1    | Advanced | 1    | Pilot-1 | New skill |

- **Assessment**: Lucky — the single roll landed on an attribute improvement, pushing her INT to 9 (+1 modifier)

### Career 2 Summary
Kelly's brief Military career was efficient despite average-to-unlucky rolls. She qualified with her weak STR, picked up Pilot (valuable for someone who already has Electronics-3), missed her special assignment and promotion, but got a lucky retirement roll that boosted her INT. The short term prevented significant advancement but added military credentials and flight skills to her rescue operator background.

## Careers Overall Assessment

Kelly Clarkson's career phase showed consistent competence with flashes of luck in key areas. Her Frontier career was defined by remarkable consistency — rolling 3 on the Advanced Education table multiple times to build Electronics to rank 3, and hitting 3/4 special assignments. Leadership advancement was exactly average. Her retirement weapon streak (four 2s) was statistically improbable but left her well-armed.

Her Military career was brief but efficient: qualified despite weak STR, gained Pilot-1, and scored an INT bump on retirement. The lack of promotion in a single term was expected.

**Final Career Statistics:**
- **Total Cash**: 37,000 Cr
- **Total Skill Ranks**: 12 (Athletics-2, Bushcraft-2, Electronics-3, Firearms-1, Mechanics-1, Pilot-1, Zero-G-1)
- **Attribute Improvements**: +2 INT (7→9), +1 SOC (5→6)
- **Equipment**: 4 Weapons, 1 Personal Vehicle

The dice created a specialist: someone who is genuinely excellent at electronics and technical rescue work, adequate in other areas, and well-equipped for field operations. Her brief Military term added credentials and piloting ability without diluting her core identity as a Frontier operator.
