Here are notes I jotted down during our session that pertain to specifically William:

- Need to find more information about the Iron Commerce 18 and what it was doing in port
- Along with Birdshit, head to local bars to carouse with dock workers
- We fed them drinks under the guise of partying and letting loose after a long day of work
- While the dock workers were intoxicated we learned the following:

    - No one came of the ship during their port, which is highly unusual
    - Nothing offloaded or onloaded, again very odd
    - They are certain that the ship inspector, Angus Graham, was bribed by those onboard
    - They only got a brief look at those onboard and they were wearing typical garb of people from Thane (all black, face covered)

- Had to pay 100 cr for "lifestyle" costs (review game rules for more details, ask questions if you don't know)
