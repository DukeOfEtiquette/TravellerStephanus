  recap: |
    The party crafted an overarching plan:
    - Dispatched a Jade Front operative to travel via middle passage from Ith to Mowebe to Thane,
      then back to Mowebe after two months of listening on Thane for updates from Mora
    - Party will take on supplies at Ith L3 point, travel to Stoyben for ship refit (fuel tanks)
      and information gathering, then jump across open space to Mowebe
    - Rendezvous with the agent planned for Campaign Week 20 (seventeen weeks out)

    At the L3 point, the party made contact with Oa Danel, an Ithian with a polished demeanor.
    She represented "Sint Motor Systems Tfd." (a JF cover R&D company) and offered:
    - Pharmaceuticals as cover cargo
    - Illicit arms to smuggle

    However, she couldn't guarantee a clean departure due to surveillance by Dylan Connell,
    an Ithian intelligence agent and true believer, along with his two deputies.

    To ensure a clean getaway, the party orchestrated Dylan's assassination:
    - Samir crafted a small bomb with limited impact
    - Victor filed a false report implicating Les Wrownand (local Bravida affiliate from Kath)
      with a plan to move on the station
    - Used the security office visit as pretext while Capt. Leeuwen (on EVA outside the station)
      teleported the bomb in via Victor's psionic ability

    The plot worked flawlessly:
    - Oa/Sint won a propaganda coup by distributing medicine to the wounded
    - Jade Front secured freedom of operation in the area
    - Party took on 16.5 tons of weapons and jumped to Stoyben

    Time: 4.6
    Location: Arriving to the Stoyben system
