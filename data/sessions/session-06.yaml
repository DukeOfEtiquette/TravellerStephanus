  recap: |
    Capt. Leeuwen returned alone to Doné Rivis at the Stoyben Interstellar News Dispatch,
    apologized for their earlier approach, and shared more information about courier routes
    and the investigation—excluding the Jade Front connection. This won Rivis's tentative trust.

    Rivis shared key intelligence:
    - Choo is always punctual — the prolonged silence is very out of character
    - Choo has an assistant who delivers his stories: Pardeep Sarsar
    - The common document-intake process at the News Dispatch

    Rivis called Sarsar's family, who reported no new information or knowledge of
    his location. The company also canvassed the spaceport — nobody has seen Sarsar.

    The company traded their weapons cargo to Isaiah Reed (JF station chief) for
    refined fuel and
    solicited Rivis for jobs. Rivis offered two:
      1. 40k/80k Cr — deliver encrypted message to Kara Wiley, an undercover reporter
         embedded in a political family on Thane
      2. 10k/25k Cr — check on Choo's wellbeing on Mora

    The company took on two middle passengers bound for Mowebe. William Hung
    brokered a deal to transport electronics components to Mowebe. Trade goods
    available: 20 tons electronics components and 30 tons chemicals.

    Time: 6.3
    Location: Stoyben Spaceport
    Kitty: 21,000 cr
