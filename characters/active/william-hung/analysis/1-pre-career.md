### 1.1 Sum Comparison
- **Total**: 42
- **Expected**: 42
- **Difference**: 0
- **Assessment**: Exactly average

### 1.2 Net Modifier Analysis

| Attribute | Score | Modifier |
|-----------|-------|----------|
| STR       | 8     | 0        |

| INT       | 10    | +1       |
| EDU       | 5     | -1       |
| SOC       | 3     | -1       |
| **Net**   | 42    | **0**    |

- **Assessment**: Average mechanical impact

### 1.3 Percentile Analysis

| Attribute | Score | Cumulative % | Assessment |
|-----------|-------|--------------|------------|
| STR       | 8     | 72%          | Average    |
| DEX       | 10    | 92%          | Lucky      |
| END       | 6     | 42%          | Average    |
| INT       | 10    | 92%          | Lucky      |
| EDU       | 5     | 28%          | Unlucky    |
| SOC       | 3     | 8%           | Very unlucky |

- **Summary**: 1 very unlucky, 1 unlucky, 2 average, 2 lucky, 0 very lucky

### 1.4 Variance/Spread Analysis
- **Range**: 10 - 3 = 7
- **Range Assessment**: High variance
- **Lucky Extremes** (83%+): 2 (DEX 10, INT 10)
- **Unlucky Extremes** (17%-): 2 (EDU 5, SOC 3)

### Step 1 Summary
William's rolls were statistically average in aggregate but exhibited high variance. His lucky INT enabled Mercantile qualification, while his very unlucky SOC (bottom 8%) locked him into the hardest background path. The dice created a classic underdog: clever and quick, but born with nothing.

## Step 2: Background

### 2.1 Homeworld
- **SOC**: 3 (modifier: -1)
- **Roll**: 3
- **Modified Total**: 2
- **Result**: Agricultural (Atsah)
- **Probability given SOC**: 30% (rolls 1-3)
- **Assessment**: Expected — Agricultural was the most likely result for his SOC

### 2.2 Schooling
- **SOC modifier (×2)**: -2
- **Roll**: 3
- **Modified Total**: 1
- **Result**: The Streets
- **Probability given SOC**: 40% (rolls 1-4)
- **Assessment**: Expected — The Streets was the most likely result for his SOC, though he had a 60% chance of something better

### 2.3 Psychic Talent
- **INT**: 10 (modifier: +1)
- **Roll**: 10
- **Modified Total**: 11
- **Target**: 12+
- **Result**: Fail
- **Probability of success**: 8.33%
- **Assessment**: Close miss — rolled 11, needed 12. One of the few characters with a real shot at PSI who just barely missed.

### Step 2 Summary
William's low SOC made poor background outcomes likely, and the dice delivered exactly that. His high INT gave him a rare chance at psychic talent (8.33%), but he missed by one point — a tantalizing "what if" in his backstory.

## Step 3: Terms

### 3.1 Total Terms
- **Roll**: 8
- **Result**: 5 terms
- **Probability**: 50% (rolls 7-10)
- **Assessment**: Average — 5 terms is the most common result

### 3.2 Career Distribution
- **Distribution rolls**: [2, 4]
- **Result**: Career 1 (2 terms), Career 2 (3 terms)
- **Assessment**: The short first career (2 terms) limited initial advancement but allowed for an early career change. The longer second career (3 terms) gave William time to reach Rank 3 under Vasquez's mentorship. This distribution created the narrative arc of a rough start followed by redemption.

### Step 3 Summary
Average term count with a distribution that favored his second career. The 2/3 split created dramatic pacing: a modest beginning, a failed transition, then three terms of accelerated success under a mentor.

## Pre-Career Overall Assessment

William Hung entered character creation with exactly average raw material (sum 42, net modifier 0) distributed in dramatically uneven ways. His high-variance rolls created a character of sharp contrasts: clever and quick (INT 10, DEX 10) but low-born and uneducated (SOC 3, EDU 5). The dice mechanically forced him into the hardest background (Agricultural + The Streets) while giving him the mental tools to escape it.

The near-miss on psychic talent (rolled 11, needed 12) adds a "what might have been" element — William is one of the rare characters who had a real shot at PSI and came within one point of a completely different life path.

The pre-career phase established William as the quintessential underdog: a street kid from a farming moon who had nothing handed to him but possessed the raw cleverness to make something of himself. Every advantage he would gain would have to be earned.
