      Earth-like moon around a gas giant. Advanced agricultural technology,

      around the starport.

  backstory: |
    At 18, William snuck aboard an outbound freighter hidden in a cargo container
    of blue yak cheese. When they found him three days out, the captain was ready
    to space him, but William talked his way into a job instead of an airlock.
    He started in the galley, washing dishes and serving meals to passengers.
    His natural charm turned out to be worth more than the cargo he'd hidden behind.

    Over two terms he worked his way up from galley rat to junior purser, learning
    to handle difficult passengers (Steward), cut favorable deals for the ship
    (Broker), and navigate the shadier corners of every starport they visited
    (Streetwise). He threw the best crew parties in the fleet (Carousing) and
    eventually earned a promotion to Rank 1. When he mustered out at 26, he walked
    away with 30,000 credits, a ground car he'd won in a card game, and enough
    polish to almost pass for respectable.

career_2:
  name: Mercantile
  attempted: Military
  drafted: true

  backstory: |
    Captain Mira Vasquez was the one who found William hiding in that cargo
    container eight years earlier. She could have spaced him, but she saw
    something in the fast-talking kid and gave him a chance instead. By the
    time William mustered out at 26, she had moved on to bigger things: her
    own ship, then a small fleet, then a stake in a growing trade consortium.

    When the military rejected William, he was adrift. No plan, no prospects,
    drinking away his mustering-out pay in a starport bar on Stoyben. Then
    Vasquez tracked him down. She was expanding into new routes through the
    Mora cluster and needed someone she could trust. Not just someone competent,
    but someone who owed her, someone loyal.

    William owed her his life. When she asked, he couldn't say no.

    The next three terms were the most successful of his career. Vasquez put
    him in positions where he could shine, gave him special assignments that
    let him prove himself, and advocated for his promotions. By the end, he'd
    reached Rank 3, paid back everything he owed her, and built a reputation
    of his own. They parted as equals, or close to it.

  story: |
    William spent two years and 50,000 credits at the Adabicci Flight Academy,
    finally learning to pilot the shuttlecraft he'd inherited. He'd spent his
    whole career as a passenger, watching pilots from the jump seat. Now he
    wanted to understand what they did, to feel the controls in his own hands.

    It wasn't easy. He crashed two simulators and dented the landing gear on
    his practical exam. But by the end, he could take off, land, and navigate
    between systems without killing anyone. Not graceful, but competent. For
    the first time in his life, he didn't need to rely on someone else to get
    where he was going.

      notes: |
        The captain who found William stowed away in a cargo container and
        gave him a chance instead of spacing him. Later recruited him into
        her trade consortium. They parted as equals after his second career.

  notes: |
    William Hung grew up with nothing on Atsah; a poor agricultural world where
    he had no family farm, no prospects, just street smarts and a mouth that
    moved faster than his brain. At 18, he stowed away on a freighter hidden
    in a cargo container of blue yak cheese. Captain Mira Vasquez found him
    and gave him a chance instead of an airlock.

    Over the next twenty years, William climbed from galley rat to Chief Broker
    on one of the most successful ship liners in the sector. His low Social
    Standing (SOC 4) meant the upper echelon—nobles, CEOs, politicians—never
    fully accepted him as one of their own. But he was indispensable as a
    second-in-command, the man who made deals happen. He brokered transactions
    worth hundreds of millions of credits, served as the perfect steward to
    VIPs who trusted him with their comfort and secrets, and threw legendary
    parties that rallied the crew after tense business days. The common folk
    and lower ranks loved him; he was one of them who made good.

    But William hit a ceiling. In the business world, there's only so far a
    man with his background can rise. The corner offices and board seats would
    always go to someone with better breeding. He'd made his fortune, earned
    his reputation, and found himself wanting something different. Something
    with more danger, more uncertainty, more room to operate.

    At 38, he retired wealthy and spent two years learning to pilot, finally
    mastering the shuttlecraft he'd inherited. Now 40, with 21,400 credits,
    a small fleet of vehicles, and a laser pistol on his hip, William has
    joined a mercenary group that specializes in eccentric work—the kind of
    jobs that don't fit neatly into any category. He's not sure what comes
    next, but for the first time in years, that uncertainty feels like freedom.
