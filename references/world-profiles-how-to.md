Universal World Profile,
Traveller uses a system conceit called the "Universal World Profile," or "UWP," to randomly generate and then structure game information about different worlds. Traveller Stephanus uses a simplified variation.

The format is:
[ABCDX]-xxx-xx[PIAQ]
... where "x" expresses a digit in hexadecimal notation.

Starport,
The first element declares the most advanced starport in the system, using a code of A, B, C, D, or X to correspond with the same class of starport. 

Physical Characteristics,
The second set of elements describes, in relative terms, the dominant world's physical characteristics. 

Each characteristic is rated on a scale centered on seven, representing an Earth-typical average. Lower numbers represent the "low/scarce" pole, while higher numbers represent the "high/abundant" pole. In most cases, central numbers (closer to seven) are more amenable to Earth-typical life.

Size,
The primary world's physical mass--and gravity.

Atmosphere,
The relative mass and suitability of the atmosphere for human life. Low scores (2-4) may mean trace or otherwise inadequate atmospheres, while high scores (10-12) may indicate stifling or tainted atmospheres.

Together, size and atmosphere influence the planet's temperature profile.

Hydrosphere,
The percentage of the surface covered in water (or similar), expressed in 10% blocks.

Human Characteristics,
The next set of elements includes two hexadecimal codes related to human life and activity. 

Population,
The first describes the whole human population of the world, with the code representing the number of zeros in the population. Thus, an average roll of seven represent a total population of tens of millions. 

Law Level,
This code represents the harshness of regulations and discipline on the world, with the low end representing highly libertarian, anti-hierarchical, unencumbered societies, and the high end representing extremely oppressive regimes. Seven represents roughly a roughly contemporary Western balance of rights and privileges with regulations and constraints. 

Technology Level,
The final code determines the general level of technological achievement in the civilization:
P for primitive technology (anything from stone or iron age to pre-industrial society),
I for industrial technology (roughly 18th-20th century on Terra).,
A for atomic technology (roughly fusion-powered, electrified and highly information-driven societies),
Q for quantum technology, which is mostly so advanced that it appears like magic to most peoples--including the ability to manufacture jump drives, reality-warping weapons, and system-scale mega infrastructure.
