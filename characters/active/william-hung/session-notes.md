### Locations Visited

- Kath starport (600 miles from I'ith)

### Items Gained/Lost
- (+) Voice of Liberation II (shared party ship)
- (-) 60k cr worth of military hardware (to pirates)
- (-) 200 Cr (party expenses)

### Credits
- Starting: 25,000 Cr (personal)
- Ending: 25,000 Cr (personal)
- Net: 0 Cr
- Party Kitty: 149,800 Cr

### Clues/Information Learned
- Death mask was found/stolen from Mora antiquities market 71 years ago (end of 2nd Agretic War)
- It turned up in Keith Sevont's collection (soldier from Newhall)
- After Sevont's death, his descendants tried to repatriate it to Ith, but it disappeared again
- Journalist Choophong Thanatkha (Stoyben, working on Mora) broke the story
- IIP also approached the party discreetly

### Unresolved Threads
- Who currently has the death mask?
- What is IIP's interest in the party/mask?
- Voice of Liberation II - what else might be hidden aboard?

### Notes
The blackmail approach to the pirates was elegant - no combat, minimal risk. But letting them escape with 60k of hardware may come back to haunt us. The Bravida affiliate now knows we're willing to deal.

## Session 3
**Date:** 2026-01-24

### Summary
Investigated the Iron Commerce 18 by carousing with dock workers. Used Carousing expertise to ply them with drinks and extract intel about the suspicious freighter and its al-Thani crew.

### Key Events
- Met JF contacts Petra and Samir in I'ith
- Partnered with Birdshit to hit local bars and carouse with dock workers
- Fed dock workers drinks under the guise of partying after a long work day
- Successfully extracted intel about the Iron Commerce 18
- Party bribed customs inspector Angus Graham for falsified documents
- Departed for Ith's L3 research station for pharmaceutical cover cargo

### NPCs Encountered
| Name | Description | Location | Notes |
|------|-------------|----------|-------|
| Petra | Jade Front contact | I'ith | Shared Cooper-Akachi intel, now aboard VoL II |
| Samir | Jade Front contact | I'ith | Now aboard VoL II |
| Angus Graham | Corrupt customs inspector | I'ith | Bribed to falsify destination/cargo |
| Dock workers | Local laborers | I'ith bars | Source of Iron Commerce 18 intel |

### Locations Visited
- I'ith (capital city)
- Local bars near the docks

### Items Gained/Lost
- (-) 100 Cr lifestyle costs (personal)

### Credits
- Starting: 21,400 Cr
- Ending: 21,300 Cr
- Net: -100 Cr

### Clues/Information Learned
- Iron Commerce 18: No one disembarked during port stay (highly unusual)
- Nothing was loaded or offloaded from the ship (very odd for a freighter)
- Dock workers confirmed Angus Graham was bribed by those aboard
- Crew wore typical Thane garb: all black, faces covered
- At least two crew confirmed as al-Thani (via psychic viewing)
- Cooper-Akachi has dispatched elite operatives to Mora for the mask
- The Iron Commerce 18's "friends" are bound for "home" (al-Thani homeworld?)

### Unresolved Threads
- Where exactly is the Iron Commerce 18 headed? ("home" = al-Thani space?)
- What's the connection between Cooper-Akachi and al-Thani?
- Will our falsified documents hold up to scrutiny?

### Notes
Good use of Carousing-4 this session. Birdshit and I make a solid team for social intelligence gathering. The dock workers had no idea they were being pumped for information. The al-Thani connection is concerning - they're known for being secretive and dangerous.

## Session 4
**Date:** 2026-01-30

### Summary
Strategic planning session at the Ith L3 point. Party developed long-term intelligence-gathering plan and orchestrated assassination of Ithian intelligence agent to secure freedom of operation.

### Credits
- Starting: 21,300 Cr

### Clues/Information Learned
- Sint Motor Systems Tfd. is a JF cover R&D company
- JF operative deployed: Ith → Mowebe → Thane → Mowebe (listening for Mora intel)

### Notes
William participated in the planning process but did not serve an outstanding part in the narrative this session. The assassination plot was primarily executed by Samir (bomb), Victor (false report + teleportation), and Capt. Leeuwen (EVA delivery).

## Session 5
**Date:** 2026-02-06

### Summary
*William Hung was absent this session.*

### Key Events (Party Summary)
- Party legally declared cargo on Stoyben
- Baron Harrow's influence secured immediate shipyard slot
- Ship refit in progress (fuel tanks) - due Campaign Week 7
- Met Isaiah Reed (JF Stoyben station chief) - will trade weapons for fuel
- Reed noted JF needs weapons on Ugrik
- Investigated Stoyben Interstellar News Dispatch:
  - Antonio Jose Cuevas (JF informant) - unhelpful
  - Doné Rivis (Editor) - no knowledge of mask/Choo, worried about Choo's 3-month absence
  - Kelly Fitzpatrick (deceased shift supervisor) - ruled out as lead
- Harrow's hack attempts failed, machine destroyed
- Party purchased industrial belt sander

### NPCs Encountered
| Name | Description | Location | Notes |
|------|-------------|----------|-------|
| Isaiah Reed | JF station chief | Stoyben | Unaware of party mission specifics |
| Antonio Jose Cuevas | JF informant, Marketing Acct Mgr | Dispatch | Entitled asshole, unhelpful |
| Doné Rivis | Editor, Investigative Journalism | Dispatch | Has blackmail material (unused) |

### Credits
- Starting: 21,300 Cr
- Ending: 21,300 Cr (absent)
- Net: 0 Cr
- Party Kitty: 21,100 Cr

### Notes
William was not present. The party made progress on the Dispatch investigation but hit dead ends. Choo has been missing for 3 months, which is concerning. Harrow's failed hack and machine destruction may have consequences.

## Session 6
**Date:** 2026-02-13

### Summary
Capt. Leeuwen returned alone to Doné Rivis to apologize and share more info about courier routes. Rivis revealed key intel about Choo's assistant Pardeep Sarsar and offered two paying jobs. Traded weapons to Reed for refined fuel. William brokered a deal to transport electronics to Mowebe.

### Key Events
- Leeuwen returned to Rivis alone to apologize and give more info about courier routes
- Won Rivis's tentative trust
- Choo is always punctual — prolonged silence is very out of character
- Learned about Pardeep Sarsar — Choo's trusted assistant and courier for filing stories
- Sarsar is also missing — family has no sign or recent communication
- Nobody at spaceport has seen Sarsar either
- Learned about News Dispatch common document-intake process
- Traded weapons cargo to Isaiah Reed for refined fuel
- Solicited Rivis for jobs — two offers received
- Took on two middle passengers to Mowebe
- William brokered deal to transport electronics to Mowebe
- Trade goods available: 20 tons electronics components, 30 tons chemicals

### NPCs Encountered
| Name | Description | Location | Notes |
|------|-------------|----------|-------|
| Doné Rivis | Managing Editor, Investigative Reporting | Dispatch | Tentative trust achieved, offered two jobs |
| Isaiah Reed | JF station chief | Stoyben | Traded weapons to him |
| Pardeep Sarsar | Choo's assistant/courier | Unknown | Missing — new lead (mentioned by Rivis) |
| Kara Wiley | Undercover reporter | Thane | Mentioned by Rivis — embedded in political family |

### Locations Visited
- Stoyben Spaceport
- Stoyben Interstellar News Dispatch

### Items Gained/Lost
- (-) 16.5 tons weapons cargo (traded to Isaiah Reed for refined fuel)
- (+) Two middle passengers
- (+) Trade goods available: 20t electronics, 30t chemicals

### Credits
- Starting: 21,300 Cr (personal)
- Ending: 21,300 Cr (personal)
- Net: 0 Cr
- Party Kitty: 21,000 Cr

### Clues/Information Learned
- Choo is always punctual — prolonged silence is very out of character
- Pardeep Sarsar is Choo's trusted assistant and frequent courier for filing stories
- Sarsar is also missing — family has had no sign or recent communication
- Nobody at Stoyben spaceport has seen Sarsar
- Two people connected to the same story now missing — suggests foul play
- Rivis knows nothing about the content of Choo's story or death mask connection
- News Dispatch document-intake process explained by Rivis

### Jobs Offered by Rivis
1. **Deliver encrypted message to Kara Wiley on Thane** — 40k up front, 80k on completion. Wiley is an undercover reporter embedded in a political family.
2. **Check on Choo's wellbeing on Mora** — 10k up front, 25k on completion.

### Unresolved Threads
- Where are Choo and Sarsar? Two connected disappearances.
- Will the company take Rivis's jobs?
- What is the document-intake process and how can it be leveraged?

### Notes
Active session. Personally brokered the electronics transport deal to Mowebe. The Rivis relationship is now productive — two well-paying jobs that align with our travel direction (Thane is en route to Mowebe). The Kara Wiley delivery (120k total) is lucrative and could combine with the Week 20 rendezvous plan. Sarsar's disappearance alongside Choo's — especially given that Choo is always punctual — strongly suggests someone is actively silencing people connected to the mask story.
