System Fundamentals
Classic Traveller played with an old-school mentality, but streamlined mechanics

Assumption of Competence
Traveller characters are veterans who have retired from careers that provided them special skills, and who choose to adventure rather than settle down. Your character must be driven to adventure rather than simply take up an occupation.

Assume that travellers are highly competent individuals. Very often, situations will be resolved by reference to their history (background, prior career, attributes, age, and expertise) without any throws necessary. Note: This is very different from the expectations of most traditional systems!

Expertise
Character creation will determine your areas of expertise. Each rank of Expertise measures years of professional training and experience, including high-level performance under pressure. Expertise-1 represents full occupational competency. Expertise-3 represents expert, specialized skill.

Throws
Throws may used to determine the outcome of a risky, high pressure situation. When the Referee asks for a throw, you'll roll and sum 2d6 and compare your result to a target number set by the Referee, which is based on fictional parameters. 

Modifiers (like -1 or +2) will frequently apply to a throw. Outside of combat, there are no fixed lists of modifiers. Players will reference the fiction to determine appropriate modifiers. Always ask questions to clarify the situation, like "Does my high Dexterity (DEX 10) help here?" or "Does my expertise in Navigation (Navigation-2) make that any easier?" 

Very often, throws are not necessary. A high attribute score or even Expertise-1 in some area will often be enough for you to succeed at a challenging, dangerous task without a throw.

Experience
Any increases to your scores are based solely in the fiction, and typically take years of combined study and practical application. 

Do not expect numerical increases to your stats outside of major time jumps, which vary in feasibility from campaign to campaign. 

Advancement
Advancement in the game is primarily fictional: Gain patrons and allies, accumulate money and material resources, upgrade your ship and gear, and increase your influence. 

Combat
Gunfights are deadly. Don't get into one unless you really mean to, and when you do, use cover, concealment, maneuver, surprise, and technology to your advantage. 

Attacks are thrown against 8+, with various modifiers applying. Most weapons inflict two to five dice of damage. You also take extra damage the first time you suffer a hit in combat ("first blood"). Hits are deducted directly from your Hit Protection, which is equal to the sum of your physical attributes (Strength, Dexterity, and Endurance). Armor provides damage reduction against hits by reducing hits from every damage die. When your cross your "bloodied" threshold (having lost ⅔ of HP), you must throw against incapacitation. 

Hits are recovered quickly until you're bloodied, then recover slowly without medical care.
