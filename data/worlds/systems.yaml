  - name: Spirelle
    uwp: X-A66-4AI
    starport: X
    size: A      # Large
    atmosphere: 6
    hydrosphere: 6
    population: 4  # Tens of thousands
    law_level: A   # Very restrictive
    tech_level: I  # Industrial
    description: |
      Little is known to outsiders about Spirelle, except that it is low-population
      terran planet that orbits a dim red dwarf star. The people have developed a
      famously xenophobic society that is strictly closed to outsiders for many centuries.
      While Spirelle has no presence off-world, transiting ships can freely skim gas
      from the system's five gas giants. The world vigorously protects its local region
      with a dense shield of militarized satellites and missile defenses.

  - name: Quiru
    uwp: A-796-6BQ
    starport: A
    size: 7
    atmosphere: 9  # Dense/tainted
    hydrosphere: 6
    population: 6  # Millions
    law_level: B   # Very restrictive
    tech_level: Q  # Quantum
    description: |
      Quiru is feared throughout the sector. The totalitarian government is highly
      restrictive and aggressive. Quiru's oppressive policies gave rise to the Jade Front,
      a decentralized group of freedom fighters (or terrorists) dedicated to overthrowing
      the dominion of Quiru and Newhall in the Mora cluster. Quiru manufactures the most
      advanced weapons in the entire sector, thanks to special, secret manufacturing techniques.

      Quiru has affirmed a political alliance with Newhall over the last century, after
      assisting Newhall in winning the Second Agretic War against Mora. The war showcased
      the terrifying efficiency of Quiru's weapons and mercenaries.

  - name: Newhall
    uwp: A-B75-77Q
    starport: A
    size: B      # Very large
    atmosphere: 7
    hydrosphere: 5
    population: 7  # Tens of millions
    law_level: 7
    tech_level: Q  # Quantum
    description: |
      Newhall is an enormous, rocky world blessed with incredible reserves of natural
      resources, compounded by space mining opportunities in the rare chemical makeup
      of the trinary star system (two blue supergiants and a yellow star). These
      advantages have led Newhall to accumulate unprecedented wealth—and an imperialistic
      attitude toward its neighbors. Newhall possesses the most expansive shipyards in
      the sector, more vast than even Ith's, and the most advanced spacecraft,
      technologically superior even to Mowebe's.

  - name: Adabicci
    uwp: C-647-86I
    starport: C
    size: 6
    atmosphere: 4  # Thin, tainted
    hydrosphere: 7
    population: 8  # Hundreds of millions
    law_level: 6
    tech_level: I  # Industrial
    description: |
      Adabicci is famous for its extremely hedonistic culture. Perhaps the thin, tainted
      atmosphere is to blame, or the endless days spent in fully subterranean megalopolises
      away from the acidic oceans and rivers, but most Adabiccis are strongly focused on
      presentist, sometimes nihilistic attachment to pleasure. This inwardness has led to
      a rather detached attitude to fractious interstellar politics. Adabicci prefers to
      be left alone.

      Home to an extremely large foreign population thanks to lax immigration, low taxes,
      no mandatory military service, and constant carnival-like vibes. Famous through the
      sector for its pleasure circuses: "What happens on Adabicci stays on Adabicci."

  - name: Mora
    uwp: C-26A-9BQ
    starport: C
    size: 2      # Small
    atmosphere: 6
    hydrosphere: A  # Water world
    population: 9  # Billions
    law_level: B   # Very restrictive
    tech_level: Q  # Quantum
    description: |
      Mora is a medium-sized water world with atypically weak gravity due to low-density
      internal geology. Morans must wear powered exosuits on more typical planets but are
      extremely adept in zero-g.

      Nearly a billion people live in enormous, beautiful floating cities that circulate
      with the planet's currents. Many billions more live on planetary outposts and space
      habs, most on the huge manufactured ring structure orbiting Mora itself.

      For nearly a millennium, Mora was the undisputed cultural hegemon in the cluster.
      Following the Second Agretic War, its military, shipyards, and advanced spaceports
      were destroyed by Newhall (with Quiru's assistance). Mora's ancient regal motif,
      the Jade Throne, inspired the Jade Front's popular resistance. Mora remains a hotbed
      of discontent against Quiru-Newhall.

      Moran society is highly collectivist, to the point that outsiders have difficulty
      understanding Moran ethical reasoning. Some scholars theorize this difference from
      Newhall's individualistic culture underlies much of the historical competition.

  - name: Tivid
    uwp: C-4C1-73I
    starport: C
    size: 4
    atmosphere: C  # Very dense/corrosive
    hydrosphere: 1
    population: 7  # Tens of millions
    law_level: 3   # Low
    tech_level: I  # Industrial
    description: |
      Tivid is an unimportant world that occupies a crucial strategic position in the
      sector. The planet is an oppressive, venusian volcanic world with hardscrabble
      frontier culture that, despite substantial population, has yet to fully outgrow
      its origin as a long-independent colony of Quiru. Most live in huge, sealed,
      partially subterranean cities.

      The rest of the system is generally quiet and uninhabited, except for a significant
      naval base maintained by Quiru between the system's two gas giants. The planet is
      known for freewheeling, fiercely independent small governments—and a lack of reasons
      for outsiders to visit.

  - name: Thane
    uwp: C-886-5CA
    starport: C
    size: 8
    atmosphere: 8
    hydrosphere: 6
    population: 5  # Hundreds of thousands
    law_level: C   # Extremely restrictive
    tech_level: A  # Atomic
    description: |
      Thane is a particularly earth-like planet, though the dominant culture is highly
      socially rigid, with individuals bound tightly into a brutal caste-based system.
      The government practices strict control over procreation, artificially restricting
      citizens to a few hundred thousand.

      Outsiders' presence and movement is extremely regulated, with few beyond "guest
      workers" permitted to even leave the spaceport—if they can even acquire a landing
      permit. Despite this, Thane is home to highly advanced extraction industry, including
      production of much of the exotic matter necessary for the cluster's atomic-era fusion
      engineering, making Thane an indispensable trading partner.

      Thane and Wal-ta-ka have historically been rivals, though the relationship has
      thawed in recent decades.

  - name: Wal-ta-ka
    uwp: C-795-B5I
    starport: C
    size: 7
    atmosphere: 9  # Dense
    hydrosphere: 5
    population: B  # Hundreds of billions
    law_level: 5
    tech_level: I  # Industrial
    description: |
      Wal-ta-ka is an extremely populous terran planet. Despite not yet achieving advanced
      technology, it has used its wealth and massive industrial capacity to build a
      significant military. The system is heavily developed, with multiple colonized
      (but mostly not self-sufficient) outposts, including the holy monastery planet
      of Lih-ta-ka, strictly off limits to outsiders.

      The Ta-ka-ti are known as a belligerent, imperialistic presence, and their agents
      are often suspected of espionage, infiltration, and sabotage. Despite the government's
      poor reputation, Wal-ta-ka and its two large moons are home to numerous natural
      wonders, boasting a large and lucrative tourism industry.

  - name: Karabeth
    uwp: X-4A3-A7P
    starport: X
    size: 4
    atmosphere: A  # Dense/unusual
    hydrosphere: 3
    population: A  # Tens of billions
    law_level: 7
    tech_level: P  # Primitive
    description: |
      The Karabeth system is little more than a transit point to more relevant
      civilizations. Karabeth itself is a small, sweltering jungle moon orbiting the
      sixth of seven massive gas giants—and one brown dwarf—in the binary system.
      The planet is peopled by a primitive civilization organized into huge city-states,
      each home to hundreds of millions of souls.

  - name: Maitz
    uwp: D-563-36I
    starport: D
    size: 5
    atmosphere: 6
    hydrosphere: 3
    population: 3  # Thousands
    law_level: 6
    tech_level: I  # Industrial
    description: |
      Already an arid, martian world, Maitz seems to be a planet in terminal decline
      following centuries of climate change that decimated the hydrosphere. Terraforming
      efforts largely failed to staunch runaway desertification. The population is now
      extremely low, just a few thousand destitute individuals, criminals, and outcasts
      living in ghost cities of a previously glorious culture.

      Aside from treasure hunters and relic pickers, Maitz no longer features any economic
      activity, and its infrastructure has fallen into ruin. According to folklore,
      civilization in the sector started on Maitz before spreading throughout the cluster.

  - name: Jokotre
    uwp: C-9B7-46I
    starport: C
    size: 9      # Large
    atmosphere: B  # Corrosive
    hydrosphere: 7
    population: 4  # Tens of thousands
    law_level: 6
    tech_level: I  # Industrial
    description: |
      Jokotre is a large, wet planet constantly shrouded in thick, alkaline clouds.
      The jaundiced atmosphere makes typical agriculture difficult, so Jokotrians rely
      on advanced hydroponics. The planet is largely uninhabited except for a few
      frontier cities centered around extraction industries, especially rare aquatic
      delicacies.

  - name: Ith
    uwp: A-673-C9Q
    starport: A
    size: 6
    atmosphere: 7
    hydrosphere: 3
    population: C  # Trillions
    law_level: 9
    tech_level: Q  # Quantum
    description: |
      A generally arid planet, Ith sports a massive population of trillions. Known for
      highly advanced technology and influential culture in the region, with most
      diplomats learning Ith as the prestige language. Iths have developed an adventurous,
      energetic culture of starfaring and colonization. Ith trades peacefully with
      Stoyben, and over the last hundred years the two polities have drawn closer.

  - name: Stoyben
    uwp: B-457-C5I
    starport: B
    size: 4
    atmosphere: 5  # Thin
    hydrosphere: 7
    population: C  # Trillions
    law_level: 5
    tech_level: I  # Industrial
    description: |
      Despite its wet (mostly icy) climate, the Stoyben system is home to a massive
      population. Hundreds of billions live on the planet's frigid surface, while
      trillions more live in permanent orbital habitats throughout the system. Due to
      the slight gravity, Stoybeni are tall and slender, and their architecture can be
      uncomfortable for more compact humanoids. Stoyben's laissez faire culture makes
      it a popular system for traders throughout the sector.

  - name: Ugrik
    uwp: D-466-4AI
    starport: D
    size: 4
    atmosphere: 6
    hydrosphere: 6
    population: 4  # Tens of thousands
    law_level: A   # Very restrictive
    tech_level: I  # Industrial
    description: |
      Ugrik is a small, cold, depopulated world with a highly insular, religious society
      ruled by a council of clerics, the Convocation. Independent asteroid miners work
      highly productive fields in the system's four asteroid fields for gallium, beryllium,
      cobalt, and rare upper-table elements. Ugricyi colonies are present throughout
      the system.

  - name: Atsah
    uwp: C-377-86I
    starport: C
    size: 3
    atmosphere: 7
    hydrosphere: 7
    population: 8  # Hundreds of millions
    law_level: 6
    tech_level: I  # Industrial
    description: |
      A modest, Earth-like moon around a gas giant, Atsah was a massive terraforming
      success for Mowebean scientists. Now long independent, Atsah possesses especially
      advanced agricultural technology and productivity. Atsahn steak and blue yak milk
      are favored delicacies on several planets.

      Atsah has developed a relatively pacifistic, decentralized, regionalized system
      of government, and remains culturally (even if no longer politically) aligned
      with Mowebe.

  - name: Mowebe
    uwp: A-769-36A
    starport: A
    size: 7
    atmosphere: 6
    hydrosphere: 9
    population: 3  # Thousands (on planet)
    law_level: 6
    tech_level: A  # Atomic
    description: |
      A water world of advanced starfarers. The vast majority of Mowebe's citizens live
      in diaspora throughout the sector, many on permanent, roving trade cities composed
      of ad hoc collections of smaller modular space stations and spacecraft.

      Mowebean orbital shipyards produce most of the ships in the sector, rivalled only
      by those of Ith and Newhall. Jewelry and fine art produced on Mowebe are highly
      sought after throughout the cluster. Mowebe is a luxury tourist destination famed
      for its beaches and underwater resorts.
