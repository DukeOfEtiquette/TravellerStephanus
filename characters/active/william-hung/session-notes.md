### Locations Visited

### Items Gained/Lost
- (+) Voice of Liberation II (shared party ship)
- (-) 60k cr worth of military hardware (to pirates)
- (-) 200 Cr (party expenses)

### Credits
- Starting: 25,000 Cr (personal)
- Ending: 25,000 Cr (personal)
- Net: 0 Cr
- Party Kitty: 149,800 Cr

### Clues/Information Learned
- Death mask was found/stolen from Mora antiquities market 71 years ago (end of 2nd Agretic War)
- It turned up in Keith Sevont's collection (soldier from Newhall)
- After Sevont's death, his descendants tried to repatriate it to Ith, but it disappeared again
- Journalist Choophong Thanatkha (Stoyben, working on Mora) broke the story
- IIP also approached the party discreetly

### Unresolved Threads
- Who currently has the death mask?
- What is IIP's interest in the party/mask?
- Voice of Liberation II - what else might be hidden aboard?

### Notes
The blackmail approach to the pirates was elegant - no combat, minimal risk. But letting them escape with 60k of hardware may come back to haunt us. The Bravida affiliate now knows we're willing to deal.

## Session 3
**Date:** 2026-01-24

### Summary
Investigated the Iron Commerce 18 by carousing with dock workers. Used Carousing expertise to ply them with drinks and extract intel about the suspicious freighter and its al-Thani crew.

### Key Events
- Met JF contacts Petra and Samir in I'ith
- Partnered with Birdshit to hit local bars and carouse with dock workers
- Fed dock workers drinks under the guise of partying after a long work day
- Successfully extracted intel about the Iron Commerce 18
- Party bribed customs inspector Angus Graham for falsified documents
- Departed for Ith's L3 research station for pharmaceutical cover cargo

### NPCs Encountered
| Name | Description | Location | Notes |
|------|-------------|----------|-------|
| Petra | Jade Front contact | I'ith | Shared Cooper-Akachi intel, now aboard VoL II |
| Samir | Jade Front contact | I'ith | Now aboard VoL II |
| Angus Graham | Corrupt customs inspector | I'ith | Bribed to falsify destination/cargo |
| Dock workers | Local laborers | I'ith bars | Source of Iron Commerce 18 intel |

### Locations Visited
- I'ith (capital city)
- Local bars near the docks

### Items Gained/Lost
- (-) 100 Cr lifestyle costs (personal)

### Credits
- Starting: 21,400 Cr
- Ending: 21,300 Cr
- Net: -100 Cr

### Clues/Information Learned
- Iron Commerce 18: No one disembarked during port stay (highly unusual)
- Nothing was loaded or offloaded from the ship (very odd for a freighter)
- Dock workers confirmed Angus Graham was bribed by those aboard
- Crew wore typical Thane garb: all black, faces covered
- At least two crew confirmed as al-Thani (via psychic viewing)
- Cooper-Akachi has dispatched elite operatives to Mora for the mask
- The Iron Commerce 18's "friends" are bound for "home" (al-Thani homeworld?)

### Unresolved Threads
- Where exactly is the Iron Commerce 18 headed? ("home" = al-Thani space?)
- What's the connection between Cooper-Akachi and al-Thani?
- Will our falsified documents hold up to scrutiny?

### Notes
Good use of Carousing-4 this session. Birdshit and I make a solid team for social intelligence gathering. The dock workers had no idea they were being pumped for information. The al-Thani connection is concerning - they're known for being secretive and dangerous.

### Clues/Information Learned
