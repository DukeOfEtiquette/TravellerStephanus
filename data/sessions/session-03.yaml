  recap: |
    The party rendezvoused with their two JF contacts in I'ith, Petra and Samir. Petra shared
    a street-level rumor that Cooper-Akachi have dispatched an elite team of operatives to
    Mora in pursuit of the mask.

    The party investigated the rumor, learning of a 300 ton tramp freighter, the Iron Commerce 18,
    that falsified a cargo of pharmaceuticals and manufacturing drones en route to a destination
    that was not Mora. With Licensed Customs Inspector Angus Graham having been paid off, the
    freighter took on twenty tons of fuel and did no trade.

    Thanks to psychic viewing and old fashioned leg work, the party confirmed that at least two
    crew of the vessel were in fact al-Thani.

    The party connected with Graham and successfully bribed him, albeit for an exorbitant rate,
    to falsify their destination as Stoyben and cargo as light construction vehicles. He informed
    them that their "friends" were bound for "home."

    At Petra's suggestion, the party departed in good order for the scientific research station
    at Ith's L3 point, where they plan to take on pharmaceutical supplies as trade cover for
    their mission.
