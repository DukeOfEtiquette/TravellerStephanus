# Pre-Career Analysis Methodology

This document provides standardized methodology for analyzing the luck of character creation rolls in Steps 1-3: Attributes, Background, and Terms.

---

## Step 1: Attributes

### Overview

Starting attributes are generated by rolling 2d6 six times, assigned in order to STR, DEX, END, INT, EDU, and SOC.

### Reference Data

#### 2d6 Probability Distribution

| Roll | Combinations | Probability | Cumulative |
|------|--------------|-------------|------------|
| 2    | 1            | 2.78%       | 2.78%      |
| 3    | 2            | 5.56%       | 8.33%      |
| 4    | 3            | 8.33%       | 16.67%     |
| 5    | 4            | 11.11%      | 27.78%     |
| 6    | 5            | 13.89%      | 41.67%     |
| 7    | 6            | 16.67%      | 58.33%     |
| 8    | 5            | 13.89%      | 72.22%     |
| 9    | 4            | 11.11%      | 83.33%     |
| 10   | 3            | 8.33%       | 91.67%     |
| 11   | 2            | 5.56%       | 97.22%     |
| 12   | 1            | 2.78%       | 100.00%    |

**Key Statistics:**
- Expected value (mean): **7**
- Variance: **5.833**
- Standard deviation: **2.415**

#### Attribute Modifier Table (Character Creation)

| Score | Modifier |
|-------|----------|
| 2     | -2       |
| 3-5   | -1       |
| 6-8   | 0        |
| 9-11  | +1       |
| 12    | +2       |

#### Six-Roll Sum Distribution

When summing six independent 2d6 rolls:
- Expected total: **42**
- Variance: 6 × 5.833 = **35**
- Standard deviation: **5.92**

| Sum Range | Percentile | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|------------|
| ≤30       | ~2%        | Extremely unlucky |
| 31-35     | ~10%       | Very unlucky |
| 36-39     | ~25%       | Unlucky |
| 40-44     | ~50%       | Average |
| 45-48     | ~75%       | Lucky |
| 49-53     | ~90%       | Very lucky |
| ≥54       | ~98%       | Extremely lucky |

### Analysis Methodology

#### 1.1 Sum Comparison

Calculate the total of all six rolls and compare to expected value.

```
Total = STR + DEX + END + INT + EDU + SOC
Expected = 42
Difference = Total - 42
```

**Interpretation:**
- Difference of 0: Exactly average
- Difference of ±1-3: Within normal variance
- Difference of ±4-6: Notably lucky/unlucky
- Difference of ±7+: Significantly lucky/unlucky

#### 1.2 Net Modifier Analysis

Calculate the sum of all attribute modifiers.

**Interpretation:**
- Net of 0: Average mechanical impact
- Net of +1 to +3: Lucky (advantaged in play)
- Net of -1 to -3: Unlucky (disadvantaged in play)
- Net of ±4+: Significantly lucky/unlucky

#### 1.3 Percentile Analysis

For each individual roll, determine its percentile using the cumulative distribution table.

**Percentile Assessment Scale:**
- ≤8%: Very unlucky
- 9-28%: Unlucky
- 29-72%: Average
- 73-92%: Lucky
- ≥93%: Very lucky

#### 1.4 Variance/Spread Analysis

**A. Range Calculation:**
```
Range = highest roll - lowest roll
```

| Range | Assessment |
|-------|------------|
| ≤4    | Low variance (consistent but unremarkable) |
| 5-6   | Normal variance |
| 7-8   | High variance (character of extremes) |
| ≥9    | Very high variance (dramatic peaks and valleys) |

**B. Extremes Count:**
- Lucky extremes: rolls at 83%+ (9, 10, 11, 12)
- Unlucky extremes: rolls at 17%- (2, 3, 4)

**C. Narrative Implications:**
Consider which attributes benefited from lucky rolls and whether they align with the character's eventual career path.

## Step 2: Background

### Overview

Background consists of three rolls:
1. **Homeworld**: 1d10 + SOC modifier
2. **Schooling**: 1d10 + (SOC modifier × 2)
3. **Psychic Talent**: 2d6 + INT modifier vs 12+

### Reference Data

#### 1d10 Probability Distribution

Each face has exactly 10% probability.

#### Homeworld Results

| Modified Roll | Result |
|---------------|--------|
| 1-2           | Agricultural |
| 3-4           | Fringe |
| 5-6           | Spacer |
| 7-9           | Industrial |
| 10+           | High Culture |

#### Homeworld Probability by SOC

| SOC | Modifier | Agricultural | Fringe | Spacer | Industrial | High Culture |
|-----|----------|--------------|--------|--------|------------|--------------|
| 2   | -2       | 40%          | 20%    | 20%    | 20%        | 0%           |
| 3-5 | -1       | 30%          | 20%    | 20%    | 30%        | 0%           |
| 6-8 | 0        | 20%          | 20%    | 20%    | 30%        | 10%          |
| 9-11| +1       | 10%          | 20%    | 20%    | 30%        | 20%          |
| 12  | +2       | 0%           | 20%    | 20%    | 30%        | 30%          |

#### Schooling Results

| Modified Roll | Result |
|---------------|--------|
| 1-2           | The Streets |
| 3-4           | Apprenticeship |
| 5-6           | Military Academy |
| 7-9           | University |
| 10+           | Finishing School |

#### Schooling Probability by SOC

| SOC | Modifier (×2) | Streets | Apprentice | Military | University | Finishing |
|-----|---------------|---------|------------|----------|------------|-----------|
| 2   | -4            | 60%     | 20%        | 20%      | 0%         | 0%        |
| 3-5 | -2            | 40%     | 20%        | 20%      | 20%        | 0%        |
| 6-8 | 0             | 20%     | 20%        | 20%      | 30%        | 10%       |
| 9-11| +2            | 0%      | 20%        | 20%      | 30%        | 30%       |
| 12  | +4            | 0%      | 0%         | 20%      | 30%        | 50%       |

#### Psychic Talent Probability

Roll 2d6 + INT modifier, need 12+ to gain PSI.

| INT | Modifier | Target on 2d6 | Probability |
|-----|----------|---------------|-------------|
| 2   | -2       | 14+           | 0%          |
| 3-5 | -1       | 13+           | 0%          |
| 6-8 | 0        | 12+           | 2.78%       |
| 9-11| +1       | 11+           | 8.33%       |
| 12  | +2       | 10+           | 16.67%      |

### Analysis Methodology

#### 2.1 Homeworld Analysis

Given the character's SOC, calculate the probability of each homeworld result. Assess whether the actual result was:
- **Lucky**: Rolled into a less likely favorable result
- **Unlucky**: Rolled into a less likely unfavorable result
- **Expected**: Got a high-probability result for their SOC

Note: "Favorable" is subjective and may depend on character concept.

#### 2.2 Schooling Analysis

Same approach as homeworld. The doubled SOC modifier makes this roll heavily influenced by social standing.

#### 2.3 Psychic Talent Analysis

For most characters, PSI is unlikely or impossible. Note whether the character:
- Had any realistic chance (INT 6+)
- Came close (rolled 10-11 with positive modifier)
- Never had a chance (low INT)

## Step 3: Terms

### Overview

Total career length is determined by:
1. **Total Terms**: Roll 2d6, consult table
2. **Career Distribution**: Roll 1d6 for each career's length until terms are allocated

### Reference Data

#### Total Terms Distribution

| Roll  | Terms | Probability | Cumulative |
|-------|-------|-------------|------------|
| 2-3   | 3     | 8.33%       | 8.33%      |
| 4-6   | 4     | 33.33%      | 41.67%     |
| 7-10  | 5     | 50.00%      | 91.67%     |
| 11-12 | 6     | 8.33%       | 100%       |

**Expected terms**: ~4.67

#### Career Length (1d6)

Each career length roll is 1d6 (each result 16.67% likely).

### Analysis Methodology

#### 3.1 Total Terms Analysis

Compare actual terms to expected (~4.67):
- 3 terms: Unlucky (bottom 8%)
- 4 terms: Slightly below average
- 5 terms: Average to lucky (most common)
- 6 terms: Lucky (top 8%)

#### 3.2 Career Distribution Analysis

Assess the distribution of terms across careers:
- **Single long career**: More time to advance in rank, accumulate skills
- **Multiple short careers**: More variety, but less advancement per career
- **Balanced split**: Moderate advancement in multiple areas

Consider whether the distribution favored or hindered the character's development.

## Example Analysis: William Hung

### Step 1: Attributes

#### Raw Data
- **Rolls**: [8, 10, 6, 10, 5, 3]

#### 1.1 Sum Comparison
- **Total**: 42
- **Expected**: 42
- **Difference**: 0
- **Assessment**: Exactly average

#### 1.2 Net Modifier Analysis

| Attribute | Score | Modifier |
|-----------|-------|----------|
| STR       | 8     | 0        |
| DEX       | 10    | +1       |
| END       | 6     | 0        |
| INT       | 10    | +1       |
| EDU       | 5     | -1       |
| SOC       | 3     | -1       |
| **Net**   | 42    | **0**    |

- **Assessment**: Average mechanical impact

#### 1.3 Percentile Analysis

| Attribute | Score | Cumulative % | Assessment |
|-----------|-------|--------------|------------|
| STR       | 8     | 72%          | Average |
| DEX       | 10    | 92%          | Lucky |
| END       | 6     | 42%          | Average |
| INT       | 10    | 92%          | Lucky |
| EDU       | 5     | 28%          | Unlucky |
| SOC       | 3     | 8%           | Very unlucky |

- **Summary**: 1 very unlucky, 1 unlucky, 2 average, 2 lucky, 0 very lucky

#### 1.4 Variance/Spread Analysis
- **Range**: 10 - 3 = 7
- **Range Assessment**: High variance
- **Lucky Extremes** (83%+): 2 (DEX 10, INT 10)
- **Unlucky Extremes** (17%-): 2 (EDU 5, SOC 3)

#### Step 1 Summary
William's rolls were statistically average in aggregate but exhibited high variance. His lucky INT enabled Mercantile qualification, while his very unlucky SOC (bottom 8%) locked him into the hardest background path.

---

### Step 2: Background

#### 2.1 Homeworld
- **SOC**: 3 (modifier: -1)
- **Roll**: 3
- **Modified Total**: 2
- **Result**: Agricultural (Atsah)
- **Probability given SOC**: 30% (rolls 1-3)
- **Assessment**: Expected — Agricultural was the most likely result for his SOC

#### 2.2 Schooling
- **SOC modifier (×2)**: -2
- **Roll**: 3
- **Modified Total**: 1
- **Result**: The Streets
- **Probability given SOC**: 40% (rolls 1-4)
- **Assessment**: Expected — The Streets was the most likely result for his SOC, though he had a 60% chance of something better

#### 2.3 Psychic Talent
- **INT**: 10 (modifier: +1)
- **Roll**: 10
- **Modified Total**: 11
- **Target**: 12+
- **Result**: Fail
- **Probability of success**: 8.33%
- **Assessment**: Close miss — rolled 11, needed 12. One of the few characters with a real shot at PSI.

#### Step 2 Summary
William's low SOC made poor background outcomes likely, and the dice delivered exactly that. His high INT gave him a rare chance at psychic talent, but he missed by one point.

---

### Step 3: Terms

#### 3.1 Total Terms
- **Roll**: 8
- **Result**: 5 terms
- **Probability**: 50% (rolls 7-10)
- **Assessment**: Average — 5 terms is the most common result

#### 3.2 Career Distribution
- **Distribution rolls**: [2, 4]
- **Result**: Career 1 (2 terms), Career 2 (3 terms)
- **Assessment**: The short first career (2 terms) limited his initial advancement, but his second career (3 terms) gave him time to reach Rank 3 under Vasquez's mentorship. A longer first career might have meant more advancement there but less dramatic character arc.

#### Step 3 Summary
Average term count with a distribution that created narrative opportunity — short first act, longer second act with a mentor figure.

---

### Pre-Career Overall Assessment

William Hung entered character creation with exactly average raw material (sum 42, net modifier 0) distributed in dramatically uneven ways. His high-variance rolls created a character of sharp contrasts: clever and quick (INT 10, DEX 10) but low-born and uneducated (SOC 3, EDU 5). The dice mechanically forced him into the hardest background (Agricultural + The Streets) while giving him the mental tools to escape it. He came tantalizingly close to psychic talent (missed by 1), adding a "what might have been" element to his story. The pre-career phase set up William as a classic underdog: a street kid with raw talent but no advantages, who would have to earn everything through wit and charm.
