## 4. Variance/Spread Analysis
- **Range**: 9 - 4 = 5
- **Range Assessment**: Normal variance
- **Lucky Extremes** (83%+): 1 roll (END 9)
- **Unlucky Extremes** (17%-): 1 roll (STR 4)
- **Narrative Implications**: The low STR made military qualification risky (she barely passed with a 6 after her -1 modifier), while her high END was perfect for a Frontier career requiring physical endurance. The unlucky SOC roll (bottom 28%) established her humble origins as a farm kid from Atsah, creating natural narrative tension as she earned her way through university on Ith and proved herself through skill rather than social standing.

## Overall Assessment

Kelly Clarkson's rolls were statistically unremarkable — one point below expected with a net modifier of -1. The distribution shows normal variance with a balanced spread: one lucky extreme (END 9) offset by one unlucky extreme (STR 4). What makes her rolls interesting is *where* the luck fell. Her high END enabled her Frontier career (+1 to qualification), while her low STR created genuine risk when joining Military (barely qualified). Her low SOC shaped her entire backstory as an outsider who had to earn her place through merit. The dice gave her a character who succeeds through grit and endurance rather than strength or social privilege — fitting for a ranch kid turned rescue operator turned special ops support.
