      (excluding JF connection). Amends made, slight levels of trust achieved.
      Revealed Pardeep Sarsar as Choo's trusted assistant/courier. Explained
      common document-intake process at the Dispatch. Checked in with Sarsar's
      family at party's request — no sign or recent communication.
