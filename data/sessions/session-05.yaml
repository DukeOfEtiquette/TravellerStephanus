  recap: |
    The company made arrangements in Stoyben to legally declare their cargo for trade and used
    Baron Harrow's influence to win an immediate slot in the shipyard for their retrofit
    (completed Week 7).

    The Jade Front station chief, Isaiah Reed, explained that he had no knowledge of the group's
    mission, but confirmed he would trade them the weapons for refined fuel. He also expressed
    a need for weapons on Ugrik, if the company ended up travelling that way.

    The company followed up on leads at the Stoyben Interstellar News Dispatch:

    1. Shook down JF informant Antonio Jose Cuevas (Marketing Account Manager) - fruitless.
       Note: Cuevas has many contacts but is a real, entitled asshole.

    2. Met with Doné Rivis (Editor for Investigative Journalism) - a large, affable man.
       - Victor's hypnosis confirmed blackmail material on Rivis (group declined to use it for now)
       - Rivis has no knowledge of the mask or Choophong Thanatkha's story
       - Rivis worried that Choo hasn't surfaced in three months

    3. Soft ruled out Kelly Fitzpatrick (shift supervisor, production/press) as a lead -
       she recently died but doesn't appear connected.

    Finally, Baron Harrow attempted to hack the Dispatch's mainframe twice to search for traces
    of Choo's story (reasoning: if filed but suppressed, traces might exist in systems).
    Both attempts failed, and when the firewall AI tried to reverse trace, Harrow was forced
    to power down and destroy the machine.

    Related: The party purchased an industrial belt sander for the ship.
