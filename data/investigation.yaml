    established: Session 3

      Customs inspector Angus Graham (bribed by IC18 crew) said their "friends"

      Victor's hypnosis confirmed he has no knowledge of the mask or Choo's story.
      Genuinely worried about Choo's disappearance.
    notes: |
      NOT fully ruled out as asset—party has unused blackmail material on him.
      Could be leveraged for access/favors if needed.

  - name: "Dispatch Mainframe (hack approach)"
    ruled_out: Session 5
    description: "Attempt to search for traces of Choo's filed/suppressed story"
    reason: |
