# Kelly Clarkson - Post-Career Analysis

## Age Calculation
- **Terms**: 5 standard, 0 Drifter
- **Calculation**: 18 + (4 × 5) + (6 × 0)
- **Final Age**: 38

## Aging Rolls Required
- **Terms 4+**: Terms 4 and 5
- **Total Rolls**: 2
- **Expected Attribute Loss**: 3.33

## Aging Roll Details

### Term 4
- **Roll**: 4
- **Effect**: Moderate — -1 from two random attributes (STR, DEX, END, INT)
- **Attribute Selection**: Rolled [1, 2] → STR and DEX
- **Attributes Affected**: STR 4→3, DEX 8→7
- **Points Lost**: 2
- **Assessment**: Average — rolled in the middle range (4-5), which accounts for 33% of outcomes

### Term 5
- **Roll**: 3
- **Effect**: Mild — -1 from one random physical attribute (STR, DEX, END)
- **Attribute Selection**: Rolled 3 → END
- **Attributes Affected**: END 9→8
- **Points Lost**: 1
- **Assessment**: Lucky — rolled in the favorable 1-3 range (50% chance)

## Cumulative Analysis

### Total Attribute Loss
- **Expected**: 3.33
- **Actual**: 3
- **Assessment**: Exactly average — lost almost exactly what was expected

### Affected Attributes Summary

| Attribute | Before Aging | After Aging | Change |
|-----------|--------------|-------------|--------|
| STR       | 4            | 3           | -1     |
| DEX       | 8            | 7           | -1     |
| END       | 9            | 8           | -1     |
| INT       | 9            | 9           | 0      |

### Distribution Assessment
Kelly's aging was evenly distributed across her physical attributes, losing 1 point from each of STR, DEX, and END. This is relatively favorable because:

1. **INT was spared entirely** — critical for a technical specialist who relies on Electronics-3 and Pilot-1
2. **No attribute dropped below functional** — STR 3 is her weakest stat (-1 modifier), but she was never a physical powerhouse anyway
3. **END and DEX remain positive** — END 8 (0 modifier) and DEX 7 (0 modifier) keep her competent in the physical demands of her work

For a rescue operator whose core competencies are technical rather than physical, this aging pattern preserves what matters most while taking the toll from attributes she already de-emphasized.

## Final State

### Hit Protection
- **Before Aging**: STR 4 + DEX 8 + END 9 = 21
- **After Aging**: STR 3 + DEX 7 + END 8 = 18
- **Loss**: 3 points (14.3%)
- **Bloodied Threshold**: 12

## Post-Career Overall Assessment

Kelly Clarkson aged gracefully for a 38-year-old with five terms of active service. Her 3 attribute points lost matched the expected 3.33 almost exactly, and the distribution was kind: evenly spread across physical stats while completely sparing her INT. This preserved her identity as a technical specialist — her Electronics-3 and INT 9 remain her defining traits, while her physical decline (STR dropping to 3) reinforces the narrative of someone who succeeded through brains rather than brawn. Her Hit Protection dropped to 18, adequate for someone who works support rather than front-line combat. The dice didn't give her any breaks on aging, but they didn't punish her either — a fair outcome for a career spent in rescue services rather than behind a desk.
