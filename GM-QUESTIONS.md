# Questions for GM

Clarifications needed based on reviewing the source materials.

## Psion Career - Material Benefits Table

The PDF layout for Psion material benefits (careers2.pdf) is ambiguous:

- Positions 2 and 4 both appear to show "Weapon" - is this correct, or should one be different?
- Position 5 shows both "+1 EDU" and "+1 PSI" in different rows - which is correct?

**Current assumption in data:**
```
1: Middle Passage
2: Weapon
3: +1 INT
4: Weapon
5: +1 EDU
6: +1 PSI
```

## Character Sheet - "Dying" Threshold

The character record sheet (charsheet.pdf) has three fields under Hit Protection:
- Armor
- Bloodied
- Dying

The rules define Bloodied as 2/3 HP lost, but **"Dying" threshold is not defined** in any of the reference materials.

**Question:** What triggers the "Dying" state? Is it 0 HP? Some other threshold?

## Attribute Abbreviation - DEX vs AGI

There's an inconsistency between the two pages of charsheet.pdf:

- **Page 1 (Character Record Sheet):** Uses **DEX** for Dexterity
- **Page 2 (Creation Worksheet):** Uses **AGI** for the same attribute

**Question:** Which abbreviation is canonical? (I've used DEX throughout the data files)
