    Campaign Setup

    Kyle Newhouse acts as the party's recruiter and contact with the Jade Front. He provides
    the initial briefing and 150k cr of starting funds in encrypted Ithian credit chips.

    Kyle explains the broad contours of the "operation":
    - An ancient, sacred Ithian death mask was apparently found at—and subsequently stolen
      from—an antiquities market on Mora at the end of the second Agretic War, some 71 years ago.
    - It turned up in the collection of a nobody soldier from Newhall named Keith Sevont. Upon
      his death, his descendants reached out to the Cultural Ministry of Ith to arrange for its
      repatriation, but before the relic could be transferred, it again disappeared.
    - Word got out about the theft, thanks to a Stoybeni investigative journalist working on
      Mora named Choophong Thanatkha. Now the race is on to recover it.
    - The Jade Front can win a massive propaganda coup against the Quiru-Newhall alliance if
      it recovers the mask and returns it to Ith—potentially shoring up a political alliance
      with Ith against Quiru-Newhall dominion.

    Play

    The party met their recruiter, Kyle Newhouse, a Jade Front operative on Ith. They were
    formerly also discreetly approached by associates of the IIP.

    Kyle briefed the party on their target, answered questions, established routines for them
    to signal for a meeting with JF agents, and then directed them as a first step to liberate
    the Voice of Liberation II, a Jade Front smuggling vessel that had been captured by pirates
    and was being held under false pretenses at the Kath starport, some 600 miles from I'ith,
    the capital city.

    The party traveled to Kath and eventually hatched a plan to blackmail the pirates into
    returning control of the ship to them on threat of legal action. The ploy worked, and
    perhaps suggested to the local Bravida affiliate that the party was at least open to
    parlay, but the operation did involve letting the criminals escape with 60k cr of military
    hardware.

    The party scrubbed the ship of spy devices, discovered a particularly well-hidden smuggling
    compartment that the "pirates" had missed, and returned to I'ith.

    Four days pass.

    Time: 1.4
    Kitty: 149,800 cr
