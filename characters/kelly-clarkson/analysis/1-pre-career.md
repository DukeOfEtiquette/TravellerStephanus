| **Net**   | 41    | **-1**   |

- **Assessment**: Slightly unlucky mechanical impact

### 1.3 Percentile Analysis

| Attribute | Score | Cumulative % | Assessment |
|-----------|-------|--------------|------------|
| STR       | 4     | 16.67%       | Unlucky    |

- **Summary**: 0 very unlucky, 2 unlucky, 3 average, 1 lucky, 0 very lucky

### 1.4 Variance/Spread Analysis
- **Range**: 9 - 4 = 5
- **Range Assessment**: Normal variance
- **Lucky Extremes** (83%+): 1 (END 9)
- **Unlucky Extremes** (17%-): 1 (STR 4)

### Step 1 Summary
Kelly's attributes were slightly below average (-1 from expected) with normal variance. Her high END enabled Frontier qualification while her low STR created risk for Military entry.

## Step 2: Background

### 2.1 Homeworld
- **SOC**: 5 (modifier: -1)
- **Roll**: 2
- **Modified Total**: 1
- **Result**: Agricultural (Atsah)
- **Probability given SOC**: 30% (rolls 1-3)
- **Assessment**: Expected — Agricultural was tied for most likely with Industrial for her SOC

### 2.2 Schooling
- **SOC modifier (×2)**: -2
- **Roll**: 10
- **Modified Total**: 8
- **Result**: University
- **Probability given SOC**: 20% (only rolls 9-10 after modifier)
- **Assessment**: Lucky — with a -2 modifier, she had only a 20% chance of University, but rolled a natural 10

### 2.3 Psychic Talent
- **INT**: 7 (modifier: 0)
- **Roll**: 9
- **Modified Total**: 9
- **Target**: 12+
- **Result**: Fail
- **Probability of success**: 2.78%
- **Assessment**: Expected failure — with no INT modifier, she needed a natural 12

### Step 2 Summary
Kelly's background shows mixed luck. Her homeworld was statistically expected for her low SOC, but she got very lucky on schooling — rolling a 10 to reach University despite the -2 modifier. This created her defining narrative: a humble farm kid who earned her way to the sector's best education through merit.

## Step 3: Terms

### 3.1 Total Terms
- **Roll**: 8
- **Result**: 5 terms
- **Probability**: 50% (rolls 7-10)
- **Assessment**: Average — 5 terms is the most common result

### 3.2 Career Distribution
- **Distribution rolls**: [4, 2]
- **Result**: Frontier (4 terms), Military (1 term)
- **Assessment**: The long first career (4 terms) gave her time to advance to Rank 2 in Frontier and develop deep expertise. The short second career (1 term) was just enough to pick up Pilot skill and military credentials without significant advancement.

### Step 3 Summary
Average term count with a distribution heavily weighted toward her first career. This allowed her to become a seasoned Frontier specialist before a brief Military stint.

## Pre-Career Overall Assessment

Kelly Clarkson entered character creation with slightly below-average raw material (sum 41, net modifier -1) distributed in a way that created clear strengths and weaknesses. Her low STR and SOC pushed her toward a humble origin, while her high END pointed toward physical careers like Frontier. The defining moment of her pre-career phase was rolling a natural 10 on schooling — with her -2 SOC modifier, she had only a 20% chance of reaching University, but she made it. This lucky roll established her entire character arc: the bright farm kid from Atsah who proved herself worthy of Ith's prestigious education, even if she never quite fit in with the trillions of urbanites around her.
