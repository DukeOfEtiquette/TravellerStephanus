Spirelle,
X-A66-4AI
Little is known to outsiders about Spirelle, except that it is low-population terran planet that orbits a dim red dwarf star, and that the people there have developed a famously xenophobic society that is strictly closed to outsiders, and has been for many centuries. While Spirelle has no presence off-world, which allows transiting ships to freely skim gas from the system's five gas giants, the world vigorously protects its local region with a dense shield of militarized satellites and missile defenses.


Quiru,
A-796-6BQ
Quiru is feared throughout the sector. From dissident reports, the totalitarian government is highly restrictive and aggressive. Quiru's oppressive governmental policies gave rise to the Jade Front, a decentralized group of freedom fighters (or terrorists, depending on who you ask) dedicated to overthrowing the dominion of Quiru and Newhall in the Mora cluster. Quiru manufactures the most advanced weapons in the entire sector, thanks to special, secret manufacturing techniques.

Quiru has affirmed a political alliance with Newhall over the last century, after it assisted Newhall in winning a long, bloody interstellar war--the Second Agretic War--against Newhall's historical enemy, Mora. The war showcased the terrifying efficiency of Quiru's weapons and mercenaries.


Newhall,
A-B75-77Q
Newhall is an enormous, rocky world blessed with incredible reserves of natural resources, an asset compounded by the space mining opportunities afforded by the rare chemical makeup of the trinary star system (two blue supergiants and a yellow star). These natural advantages have led Newhall to accumulate unprecedented wealth--and an imperialistic attitude toward its neighbors. Newhall possesses the most expansive shipyards in the sector, more vast than even Ith's, as well as the most advanced spacecraft in the sector, technologically superior even to Mowebe's.

Adabicci,
C-647-86I
Adabicci is famous for it's extremely hedonistic culture. Perhaps the thin, tainted atmosphere is to blame, or perhaps the endless days spent in fully subterranean megalopolises away from the acidic oceans and rivers, but most Adabiccis are strongly focused on a presentist, sometimes nihilistic attachment to pleasure and gratification. This inwardness has led to a rather detached attitude to the fractious interstellar politics around it. Adabicci prefers to be left alone and to get along. 

Adabicci is home to an extremely large foreign population, thanks to relatively lax immigration standards, low taxes, no mandatory military service, and the draw of the constant carnival-like vibe of many of the planet's cities. Indeed, Adabicci is famous through the sector for its pleasure circuses, which have given rise to the adage "What happens on Adabicci stays on Adabicci." 


Mora,
C-26A-9BQ
Mora is a medium-sized water world with atypically weak gravity due to a low-density internal geological structure. Morans must wear powered exosuits to survive on more typical planets, but are extremely adept in zero g. 

Nearly a billion people live in enormous, beautiful floating cities on Mora. The cities circulate along with the planet's currents. Many billions more live on planetary outposts and in space habs throughout the system, most on the huge, manufactured ring structure that orbits Mora itself.

For nearly a millenium, Mora had been the undisputed cultural hegemon in the cluster. Following the Second Agretic War, however, its military, shipyards, and even advanced spaceports were destroyed by Newhall (with Quiru's assistance). Mora's ancient regal motif, the Jade Throne, inspired the Jade Front's popular resistance against the Quiru-Newhall alliance, and Mora remains a hotbed of discontent against the more imperialistic civilizations in the cluster.

Moran society is highly collectivist, to the point that many outsiders have a difficult time understanding Moran ethical reasoning. Some scholars theorize that this difference from Newhall's individualistic culture underlies much of the historical competition between the two civilizations.

Tivid °,
C-4C1-73I
Tivid is an unimportant world that happens to occupy a crucial strategic position in the sector. The planet itself is an oppressive, venusian volcanic world, with a hardscrabble, frontier culture that, despite its substantial population, has yet to fully outgrow its origin as a long-independent colony of Quiru. Most of the population lives in huge, sealed, partially subterranean cities. The rest of the system is generally quiet and uninhabited, except for a significant naval base maintained by Quiru between the system's two gas giants. The planet Tivid itself is known for its freewheeling, fiercely independent small governments--and for a lack of reasons for outsiders to visit.

--------

Thane,
C-886-5CA
Thane is a particularly earth-like planet, though the dominant culture is highly socially rigid, with individuals bound tightly into a brutal caste-based system. The government practices strict control over procreation, which allows Thane to artificially restrict its number of citizens to a few hundred thousand. Outsiders' presence and movement on the planet is extremely regulated, with few beyond "guest workers" permitted to even leave the spaceport--if they can even acquire a landing permit. Despite this, Thane is home to a highly advanced extraction industry, including production of much of the exotic matter necessary for the cluster's atomic-era fusion engineering, which makes Thane an indispensable trading partner among other advanced polities. 

Thane and Wal-ta-ka have historically been rivals, though the political relationship has thawed in recent decades.

Wal-ta-ka,
C-795-B5I
Wal-ta-ka is an extremely populous terran planet. Despite not yet having achieved advanced technology, it has used its wealth and massive industrial capacity to build a significant military. The Wal-ta-ka system is heavily developed, with multiple colonized (but mostly not self-sufficient) outposts on other planets, including the holy monastery planet of Lih-ta-ka, which is strictly off limits to outsiders.

The Ta-ka-ti are known as a belligerent, imperialistic presence in the sector, and their agents are often suspected of espionage, infiltration, and sabotage against their enemies. Despite the government's poor reputation, Wal-ta-ka and its two large moons are home to numerous natural wonders, so it boasts a large and lucrative tourism industry.

Karabeth °,
X-4A3-A7P
The Karabeth system is little more than a transit point to more relevant civilizations. Karabeth itself is a small, sweltering jungle moon that orbits the sixth of seven massive gas giants--and one brown dwarf--in the binary system. The planet is peopled by a primitive civilization that has organized itself into huge city-states, each home to hundreds of millions of souls.


Maitz °,
D-563-36I
Already an arid, martian world, Maitz seems to be a planet in terminal decline following centuries of climate change that have decimated the planet's hydrosphere. Terraforming efforts largely failed to staunch runaway desertification. The population is now extremely low, just a few thousand destitute individuals, criminals, and outcasts living in the ghost cities of a previously glorious, vital culture. Aside from treasure hunters and relic pickers, Maitz no longer features any economic activity to speak of, and its infrastructure has fallen into ruin. According to the folklore of Maitz, civilization in the sector started on the planet before spreading throughout the cluster.

Jokotre,
C-9B7-46I
Jokotre is a large, wet planet constantly shrouded in thick, alkaline clouds. The jaundiced atmosphere makes typical agriculture difficult, so Jokotrians rely on advanced hydroponics to support themselves. The planet is largely uninhabited, except for a few frontier cities centered around extraction industries, especially rare aquatic delicacies.

Ith °,
A-673-C9Q
A generally arid planet, Ith sports a massive population of trillions. It is known for its highly advanced technology, and is an influential culture in the region, with most diplomats learning Ith as the prestige language. Iths have developed an adventurous, energetic culture of starfaring and colonization. Ith trades peacefully with Stoyben, and over the last one hundred years, the two polities have drawn closer. 


Stoyben °,
B-457-C5I
Despite its wet (mostly icy) climate, the Stoyben system is home to a massive population. Hundreds of billions live on the planet's frigid surface, while trillions more live in permanent orbital habitats scattered throughout the system. Due to the planet's (and space habitats') slight gravity, Stoybeni are tall and slender, and their architecture can be uncomfortable for more compact humanoids. Stoyben's laissez faire culture makes it a popular system for traders throughout the sector.


Ugrik,
D-466-4AI
Ugrik is a small, cold, depopulated world with a highly insular, religious society. It is ruled by a council of clerics, the Convocation. Independent asteroid miners work highly productive fields in the system's four asteroid fields for gallium, beryllium, cobalt, and rare upper-table elements. Ugricyi colonies are present through the system.


Atsah °,
C-377-86I
A modest, Earth-like moon around a gas giant, Atsah was a massive terraforming success for Mowebean scientists. Now long independent, Atsah possesses especially advanced agricultural technology and productivity. Atsahn steak and blue yak milk are favored delicacies on several planets. Atsah has developed a relatively pacifistic, decentralized, regionalized system of government, and remains culturally (even if no longer politically) aligned with Mowebe.

Mowebe,
A-769-36A
A water world of advanced starfarers. The vast majority of Mowebe's citizens live in diaspora throughout the sector, many on permanent, roving trade cities composed of ad hoc collections of smaller modular space stations and spacecraft. Mowebean orbital shipyards produce most of the ships in the sector, rivalled only by those of Ith and Newhall. Jewelry and fine art produced on Mowebe are highly sought after throughout the cluster, and Mowebe is a luxury tourist destination famed for its beaches and underwater resorts.
