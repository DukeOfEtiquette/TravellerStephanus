      Jade Front operative dispatched on intelligence-gathering circuit:
      Ith → Mowebe → Thane (2 months listening for Mora updates) → Mowebe
    action_required: "Rendezvous at Mowebe, Campaign Week 20"
    established: Session 4
    notes: |
      Traveling via middle passage tickets. Will gather intel filtering
      back from Mora about the mask situation.

  - name: "Choophong Thanatkha (Choo)"
    priority: high
    status: in_progress
    description: |
      Stoybeni investigative journalist who broke the death mask story.
      Was working on Mora. Missing for 3+ months.
    action_required: "Find Choo or determine what happened to them. Investigate Pardeep Sarsar's disappearance."
    established: Session 2
    last_update: Session 6
    notes: |
      Session 5: Editor Doné Rivis worried about disappearance. Rivis has no knowledge
      of Choo's story or current whereabouts. Dispatch mainframe hack failed.
      Session 6: Rivis revealed Pardeep Sarsar as Choo's trusted lieutenant and courier.
      Sarsar is also missing — family has no sign or recent communication.
      Two missing people connected to the same story is a pattern.

  - name: "Iron Commerce 18 / al-Thani Connection"
    priority: medium
    status: stalled

    action_required: "Track destination; investigate al-Thani involvement"
    established: Session 3
    notes: |
      Customs inspector Angus Graham (bribed by IC18 crew) said their "friends"
      were bound for "home." Crew wore typical Thane garb: all black, faces covered.
      Possible destination: al-Thani homeworld?

  - name: "Cooper-Akachi Operatives"
    priority: medium
    status: monitoring
    description: |
      Street-level intel indicates Cooper-Akachi dispatched an elite team
      of operatives to Mora in pursuit of the mask.
    action_required: "Monitor; avoid or neutralize if encountered"
    established: Session 3 (Petra's intel)
    notes: |
      Possible connection to al-Thani? Both headed toward Mora region.

  - name: "Ugrik Weapons Delivery"
    priority: low
    status: resolved
    description: |
      JF station chief Isaiah Reed noted the Front needs weapons on Ugrik.
      Party currently has 16.5 tons of weapons cargo.
    action_required: null
    established: Session 5

    description: |
      Rivis offered 40k Cr up front, 80k Cr on completion to deliver an encrypted
      message to Kara Wiley, an undercover reporter embedded in a political family
      on Thane.
    action_required: "Accept or decline. If accepted, travel to Thane and locate Wiley."
    established: Session 6
    notes: |
      Thane is en route to Mowebe (the Week 20 rendezvous). Could combine with
      travel plans. Total payout: 120k Cr.

    status: available
    description: |
      Rivis offered 10k Cr up front, 25k Cr on completion to check on Choophong
      Thanatkha's wellbeing on Mora.

    established: Session 6
    notes: |
      Aligns with party's existing Choo investigation lead. Total payout: 35k Cr.
      Mora is further afield — would require significant travel beyond current plans.

# DEAD ENDS (Leads ruled out)

dead_ends:

  - name: "Kelly Fitzpatrick"
    ruled_out: Session 5
    description: "Shift supervisor in Dispatch production/press department"
    reason: "Recently deceased but investigation found no connection to mask or Choo"

  - name: "Antonio Jose Cuevas"
    ruled_out: Session 5
    description: "JF informant, Marketing Account Manager at Dispatch"
    reason: "Has contacts but proved unhelpful when questioned. Entitled asshole."

  - name: "Doné Rivis (direct knowledge)"
    ruled_out: Session 5
    description: "Editor for Investigative Journalism at Dispatch"
    reason: |
      Victor's hypnosis confirmed he has no knowledge of the mask or Choo's story.
      Genuinely worried about Choo's disappearance.
    notes: |
      NOT fully ruled out as asset—party has unused blackmail material on him.
      Could be leveraged for access/favors if needed.

  - name: "Dispatch Mainframe (hack approach)"
    ruled_out: Session 5
    description: "Attempt to search for traces of Choo's filed/suppressed story"
    reason: |
      Baron Harrow failed both hack attempts. Firewall AI attempted reverse trace.
      Machine destroyed to prevent identification.

      Both missing. Choo: 3+ months, last known on Mora. Sarsar: Choo's trusted
      lieutenant/courier, family has no sign or recent communication. Two connected
      disappearances suggest foul play rather than coincidence.
