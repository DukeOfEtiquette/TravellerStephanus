  backstory:
    birthplace: Atsah
    birthplace_notes: |
      Earth-like agricultural moon orbiting a gas giant. Known for advanced
      farming technology, Atsahn steak, and blue yak milk. Pacifistic,
      decentralized society. Kelly grew up on a ranch, first in her family
      to leave the moon.

    university: Ith
    university_notes: |
      Most populous world in the sector (trillions). Quantum-level technology,
      influential culture, prestige language for diplomats. Kelly won a
      scholarship — a huge achievement for a farm kid from Atsah. The culture
      shock was overwhelming: quiet rural moon to bustling mega-civilization.

  appearance:
    description: |
      Deliberately unremarkable - the kind of person who blends in at both
      starport bars and wilderness outposts. Medium build, practical
      presentation. Keeps her appearance neutral enough to move between
      frontier colonies and military installations without standing out.

    clothing: |
      Adaptive smart-fabric jacket (quantum-tech from Ith, but earth-toned
      and dusty enough to look frontier-worn). Practical cargo pants.
      Fingerless gloves for technical work. Everything chosen for versatility -
      equally at home rappelling down a cliff or crawling through a ship's
      electronics bay.

    gear: |
      Modular loadout depending on mission - shotgun for wilderness, rifle
      for precision, pistol always. Electronics suite integrated into her
      jacket collar and sleeves (custom rig of her own design). Small
      agricultural token from Atsah worn on a chain - the only sentimental
      thing she carries.

  notes: |
    Kelly Clarkson grew up raising blue yaks on an Atsahn ranch. Bright and
    restless, she won a scholarship to university on Ith — the cultural and
    technological center of the sector. She excelled academically but never
    fit in among trillions of urbanites. Too educated to return to the farm,
    too rural for Ith's crowds, she joined Frontier rescue services to stay
    mobile and useful.

    16 years as a rescue operator made her an expert in electronics — finding
    distress beacons, scanning for life signs, tracking survivors through
    wilderness. Her reputation caught the attention of military special ops,
    who recruited her for covert extraction support. After one term, she
    mustered out at 38: experienced, well-equipped, and ready for adventure.
