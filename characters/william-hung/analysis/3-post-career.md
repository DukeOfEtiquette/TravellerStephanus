## Cumulative Analysis

### Total Attribute Loss
- **Expected**: 3.33
- **Actual**: 4
- **Assessment**: Slightly unlucky — lost about 0.7 points more than expected

### Affected Attributes Summary

| Attribute | Before Aging | After Aging | Change |
|-----------|--------------|-------------|--------|
| STR       | 8            | 8           | 0      |
| DEX       | 10           | 9           | -1     |
| END       | 6            | 4           | -2     |
| INT       | 10           | 9           | -1     |

### Distribution Assessment
William's aging was a mixed bag. The term 5 roll of 6 (severe aging, 16.67% chance) was painful, hitting three attributes at once. However, the distribution was favorable in key ways:

1. **STR was completely spared** — lucky on the attribute selection
2. **DEX and INT remain positive** — both dropped from exceptional (10, +1 modifier) to merely good (9, +1 modifier), preserving their mechanical benefit
3. **END took the brunt** — dropping to 4 (-1 modifier), his only attribute in penalty range

For a social/merchant character, this is about as good as a severe aging roll can be. William's core competencies (Broker, Carousing, Steward, Diplomacy) don't rely heavily on the affected attributes. His INT 9 still supports his clever, quick-witted nature.

## Final State

### Hit Protection
- **Before Aging**: STR 8 + DEX 10 + END 6 = 24
- **After Aging**: STR 8 + DEX 9 + END 4 = 21
- **Loss**: 3 points (12.5%)
- **Bloodied Threshold**: 14

## Sabbatical Note

After completing character creation at age 38, William took a 2-year sabbatical:
- **Cost**: 50,000 Cr
- **Skill Gained**: Carousing-5
- **Final Age**: 40
- **Remaining Cash**: 25,000 Cr

The sabbatical represents William spending two years and half his fortune touring every casino and pleasure den in the sector. He broke roughly even at the tables but built a legendary reputation as someone who knows everyone worth knowing in the starport bar scene.

## Post-Career Overall Assessment

William Hung's aging was slightly unlucky overall, losing 4 attribute points against an expected 3.33. The term 5 roll of 6 (severe aging) was painful — only a 16.67% chance — but the damage was mitigated by favorable attribute selection: STR was spared entirely, and DEX and INT remained in the positive modifier range despite each losing a point.

His END took the worst of it, dropping to 4 (-1 modifier), which narratively suggests a man who spent too many years at parties and business dinners rather than in the gym. For a character whose strengths are social rather than physical, he aged about as gracefully as one could hope after rolling a 6.

At 40 years old, with Hit Protection of 21 and a legendary Carousing-5, William Hung is exactly what his dice made him: a charming, clever merchant who's past his physical prime but at the absolute peak of his social game. He can walk into any starport bar in the sector and find someone who owes him a drink — or someone he owes one to.
