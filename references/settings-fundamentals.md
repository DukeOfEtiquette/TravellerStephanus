Setting Fundamentals
The implied and explicit components of Classic Traveller settings

Planets and Society
Almost all planets/systems are self-sufficient.
Interstellar commerce is reserved for the rarest and highest-value goods and commodities.
Most planets/systems operate with a substantial (or complete) degree of political autonomy.
Planets and their inhabitants display a wide variation in technological achievement.
Each planet has different laws, including those restricting weapons, travel, trade, and other topics.
Most people never travel off world. To do so is extremely expensive.
Smaller and less technologically advanced planets are rarely visited by traders.

Interstellar Travel
Almost all spacecraft are small, like the Firefly or Millennium Falcon.
Faster than light travel is available through "jump drives."
Jump drives are rated 1-5 (in parsecs/jump). Jump-1 and Jump-2 drives are by far the most common. Others are extremely rare.
Transit time in jump space always takes one week, regardless of distance jumped.
Jumps cannot be made (without great risk) within many radiuses of a gravity well, meaning that most jumps take two to three weeks to complete (one to two weeks of transit in and out of system, plus a week in jump space).
Precise navigation of jump space is difficult without recent gravitational records for the route.
Liners trade on contract along scheduled routes between the most populous and wealthy systems, while tramp freighters trade speculatively among any systems.
Passengers may travel in staterooms ("high" and "middle" passage, or--more dangerously--frozen in livestock-grade cryogenic freezers ("low" passage).

Interstellar Communication
There is no faster than light communication.
Information moves at the speed of transit, like letters sent via packet ship during the age of sail.

Starports
Class A starports can build ships. Class A and B can make major repairs. Class C and D can make minor repairs. Class X starports have no maintenance capacity whatsoever.
Refined fuel is available at class A, B, and C starports only. Unrefined fuel is available at class C and D starports, or may be skimmed from gas giants. No fuel is available at class X starports.
Unrefined fuel can cause damage to a jump drive the more it is used.
